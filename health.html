    <p>
        Nail is an alpha-keratinous plate found on the tip of fingers and toes. <span id="dots1">...</span>
        <span id="more1" style="display: none;"> This horn-like structure called nail, if defected, can indicate signs of sickness in an individual. Through a nail, its shape, color and surface, a lot of knowledge about underlying health conditions can be discovered. Starting from the extreme positive end; healthy nails are always strong, flat and white or ivory-colored, and never flaky. However, thin pale nails result due to iron deficiency in the body. To construe it up, yellowish color in nails is a result of renal and gastrointestinal tract problems. Moreover, knobbly nails represent an infection in the body. Additionally, lack of zinc, copper and iodine can lead to white dots and streaks on the nails. Crumbling yellow or black nails occur due to fungal infection. Furthermore, brittle nails result from lack of iron and beta-carotene. Pitted nails can be a cause of skin disorder, psoriasis, eczema, or arthritis. Koilonychia is a spooning of nail resulting in raised ridges that can be due to lack of iron and so on.</span>

This competitive activity makes bodybuilders to focus on hypertrophy, fat-loss and contest preparation. Bodybuilding is specialized for men and women according to their height, age, weight or body goal category. It comprises of ‘big three’ compound lifts – the squat, the bench, and the deadlift. Moreover, it signifies higher rep ranges for individual exercises, generally in 8-12 or 12-15 range are often performed in ‘superset’, where one exercise is immediately followed by another without a rest period. Cardio and diet also play a huge part in a bodybuilding program, as fat-loss and maintaining a lean physique are incredibly important. ȆSerious body building is a lifestyle requiring complete dedication, since what you eat and spend your time doing outside of the gym is equally important as the time you spend training!

    <a href="#"> How to manage sleeping schedules</a>
    <p>
        Sleeping hours might vary from an hour to hour. Such differences of time can be regulated by practicing several enlisted activities.
        It can be harsh for you to<span id="dots13">...</span>
        <span id="more13" style="display: none;">   exactly maintain your sleep hours every day. Somehow, you need to show patience to yourself. For this, you can arrange the bedtime environment by switching off lights. It is necessarily important to avoid exertion when you are near to hit the hay as it will energize you, escaping from sleep. Another secret of supervising sleep hours (that are ultimately the fitness regulator) is to avoid intake of food. Besides the fact that the environment has a great impact, it is vital to eat early, exercise at daytime, and give a stimulus of sleep to your brain at night. This stimulus can opt any form like low light, relaxed body posture, and no noise. Likewise, the stimulus of sleep-time can also be any activity like reading a book daily in a relaxed-spine position before going to bed, and so on. These activities, when performed daily, will showcase your brain the time to have forty winks.

    <a href="#"> Factors affecting aging</a>
    <p>
        Aging is the most anxiety-causing factor in adults of the present day. There are many factors affecting aging that briefly include water, food, sleep, functionality, mental state and unnecessary fears. Following<span id="dots12">...</span>
        <span id="more12" style="display: none;">    are the succinct descriptions of the factors:<br>
            1. Water is an essential element of life. It eradicates all the signs of dryness. Therefore, intake of water is inversely proportional to aging. The more the water is taken, the less it is susceptible to aging.<br>
            2. Food is fuel. To combat aging, one needs to regulate intake of three respective colors; green, yellow and white. Green color is an evidence of chlorophyll which is found in various fruits and vegetables. Yellow color presents food rich in enzymes and vitamin B complex, whereas white color resonates with an alkaline and fibre-rich diet.<br>
            3. Fitness is a part of relaxation and sleep. It is better not to sleep too much or too less, but it must be for 7-8 hours in accordance with nature's biological clock. Hence, lawbreaking (being a night owl or snoozing in day) is prohibited.<br>
            4. Make sure to exercise and to perform stretches so that activity of muscles does not fade away.<br>
            5. Mental state is always given a priority to maintain its fitness and proactivity. One needs to make sure about his healthy and peaceful mindset. Because, the one with depression and anxiety will be the worst culprit.<br>
            6. Lastly, but most importantly is the factor of not keeping unnatural fear of aging. It has been researched that the people who continuously fear about aging are usually the prey to it.<br>
            
            Enlisted above are the features of aging and we are in dire need of tips permitting us to enjoy teen-age once again. Therefore, we need to legalize healthy lifestyles, and to have benefits from natural sources.

    <a href="#"> Body posture: “Symbol of fitness”</a>
    <p>
        Fitness industry, comprising few pillars, is way so established in this era. One of these pillars is “Posture.” As the human body is perfectly designed and scheduled, yet <span id="dots17">...</span>

            Do’s:<br>
            1. Sit straight!<br>
            2. It is necessary to strengthen up muscles especially, the spinal and abdominal muscles.<br>
            3.  Exercise; lay down on an object placed at your back just at the level of your navel, join your pinkies of hands just above your head and toes of your feet below.<br>
            4. Spine and lower back workouts will certainly let your joints thank you.<br>
            5. If you wear a bag, make sure to put the weight over both of your shoulders.<br>
            6. While using the screen, there should always be a 30cm distance between your eyes and the electronic object.<br>
            
            Don’ts:<br>
            1. Avoid a slouched posture as it crushes the nerve-endings.<br>
            2.  Refrain from hunch-posture that induces pressure on organs; disturbing normal working of heart, abdomen and limbs.<br>
            3. Desist from saggy position as it can distort internal organs from their origins.<br>
            4. Don’t lower your head while reading a book or using a phone.<br>
            5. While using the keyboard of your system, make sure not to tilt your 90 degree angle of hands.<br>

There is no exact cure for such diseases, but they can be controlled with antibiotics, change in life-style or sometimes surgery (in IBD). However, pain can be felt in the whole abdominal region. A doctor can diagnose the kind of disorder due to specific localization of pain. For instance, pain in the lower-left region identifies IBS. While, left-sided pains are a definitive cause of ulcerative colitis (IBD).

        People are gradually being aware of the eyes-exercises and have begun calling it a natural remedy to cure eyesight problems. If you are facing any problem of near-sightedness or far-sightedness, <span id="dots11">...</span>
        <span id="more11" style="display: none;">  cataracts, or macular-degeneration due to aging, then you are probably going to benefit from the following exercises: <br>

           1) Focus on your point finger a few inches away from your eyes and gradually increase the distance. Remember to keep focusing, and bring that finger slowly towards your eyes. Do it 3 times at least to improve your focus.<br>
            
           2) Create a pinhole with your finger and focus the images through it. This exercise will help you to strengthen your concentration.<br>
            
           3) Focus on your thumb ten-inches away from your eyes for 15 seconds. Then instantly find an object 10-15 feet away and focus on it. Repeat it five times.<br>
            
           4) Trace an imaginary figure 8 with your eyes on the floor. Let the distance be 10 feet. Practice it 30 times, constantly.<br>
            
           5) To cope up with eye-sight problems, the 20-20-20 rule is going to be your savior. Stare/focus on an object every 20 minutes at 20 feet away for 20 seconds.<br>
            
           6) Perform eye yoga frequently. Sit straight with your shoulders off. And rotate your eyes in a clockwise and anticlockwise direction. Remember not to abandon focus. Focus on the image along your direction and continue within the loop.<br>
            
           7) Blink your eyes slowly every time as it keeps moist and permits eligibility to focus longer.<br>
            
           8) Try to write on the walls rotating your lens along the direction of alphabets.<br>
            
           9) Palming your eyes is another efficient tip to relax your eyes. Put your light palms of both hands on your eyes and press them cordially with a light thrust.  <br>

    <a href="#"> The harmful effects of carbonated beverages</a>
    <p>
        Americans take about 13 billion gallons of fizzy drinks per year. Fizzy drinks can be taken temporarily as an alternative to water, but sodas typically contain carbon dioxide, sugar, phosphoric<span id="dots10">...</span>
        <span id="more10" style="display: none;">  and citric acid, sodium, and excess calories. These components harm the body by causing problems like dehydration (dry skin and acne), calcium depletion, weight gain, high blood sugar, dementia, strokes and depression that can further lead to health complications i.e., liver damage and aging. Beverages purely contain large amounts of sugars that are turned into fats in the body, leading to belly fat accumulation. Moreover, sodas contain no nutrients. Hence, they just contribute to unnecessary calories, and resist your body from regulating the number of calories you eat and burn. Excess sugars is the principal cause of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Sugary drinks also cause heart diseases and cancer. Likewise, postmenopausal women who are more likely to drink carbonated beverages can be prey to endometrial cancer. Besides, fizzy drinks are a disaster to your dental health and bones (gout; due to accumulation of uric acid crystals). To conclude, it is important to abandon these drinks as soon as possible as they are injurious to our health. Let’s give your body a chance to heal and detoxify. Eat healthy!

    <a href="#"> Smoking</a>
    <p>
        Smoking is a serious concern prevailing in the world. The physical cravings of smoking include tension, anxiety and throat or belly tightness etc. that induce the desire to smoke. But smoking actually <span id="dots9">...</span>
        <span id="more9" style="display: none;">  causes 90% of the deaths than caused by any other source like HIV, motorcycle injuries and use of illegal drugs. 80% of the deaths are due to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (caused by smoking) and 2 to 4 times deaths occur due to coronary heart disease and stroke. Whereas, the other harms include the low fertility rate, blood and cervical cancer, miscarriage and birth defects due to affected sperms in man. On the flip side, women-smokers usually face the problems like stillbirth, preterm, low birth weight, and orofacial clefts in infants. Moreover, bones are severely weakened due to smoking. Additional signs include infected gums, cataracts, type 2 diabetes mellitus, early menopause, rheumatoid arthritis, pneumonia, skin problems, ulcers, inflammation, high cholesterol, loss of appetite, bad breath, and loss of immunity. There also develops the risk of death, most smokers fail to reach their 65 years of age. To sum it up, lungs have magical ability to cure, but only if you stop smoking. Hence, it is important to either reduce smoking or entirely eliminate it. Nicotine takes 72 hours to get out of your body, thus, a person can escape from his cravings for nicotine in 12 days. Occasional smokers are exposed to less harm. While, a heavy smoker who quits smoking later halves his risk of death and rejuvenates his body organs back to normal within 5-10 years.

        <span id="more8" style="display: none;"> to getting up as soon as your alarm goes off.  There is truly no sound worse than an alarm clock. When you hit the snooze button and wake up ten to twenty minutes later, you disturb your sleep-wake cycle which makes you disoriented. Besides, exposing yourself to sunlight exactly after you open your eyes is barely tough. Yet, it is important to permit your body for efficient functioning like activating hormones and promoting digestion, knowing that it is day time. Otherwise, it disturbs your natural cycle of the body. Drink a glass of luke-warm water exactly after you rise and shine so that you could have smooth digestion throughout the day. It flushes toxins from your gut, and burns more calories throughout the day. Hence, it helps you to lose weight. It can be even more efficient if you squeeze a lemon in the cup of water that makes you a little fuller, preventing you from taking a heavy breakfast. Furthermore, research shows that drinking more water can help you fight chronic kidney diseases and other bodily issues. Overall, the more water you drink, the more effectively your body functions. In addition, start your day with a mobilizing exercise which can warm you up, as it is obviously a great way for warming up and lubricating your joints. It is always better to have a more nutritious breakfast rather than sweet treats.

Thus, you can apt for fruits like blueberries, raspberries and strawberries, as they are less in sugar than other fruits, and rich in antioxidants. If you are less likely to have sweet breakfast, you can go for protein sources like egg and milk.

    <a href="#">How to Tackle Food Allergies</a>
    <p>
        Food allergy is the hypersensitive immune response of the body due to certain food allergens. The most commonly associated allergy causing foods are fish,   <span id="dots6">...</span>
        <span id="more6" style="display: none;"> shellfish, milk, wheat, tree nuts, peanuts, egg and soy. Nowadays, the rate of food allergy has been inclined to level up. As an allergy can be life threatening, visit your nutritionist if you face food discomfort. Food allergy refers to an immune system reaction affecting different body organs. On the flip side, food intolerance has less serious signs and does not involve the immune system. Therefore, it is your task to identify and track the food you take to pinpoint the problem. Once you pinpoint the upsetting food, you should immediately stop consuming that. Play the detective role of yours; make a diet plan or food diary when symptoms occur, and identify the causative food and its allergy symptoms. Moreover, limit those foods which do not upset your gut. You can try food options as well, and acknowledge whether they are right for your stomach or not. You can also help yourself in exploring the diet you take regularly, if signs and symptoms are continual. However, it is necessary to consult your dietician for your diet in order to enjoy a healthy life.   </i> </span>

    <a href="#">How Busy People Manage their Health?</a>
    <p>
        Majority of people are facing the issue to supervise their health due to reasons that vary in tones. Either, they face the time shortage or their fragile imbalanced  <span id="dots2">...</span>
        <span id="more2" style="display: none;"> diet doesn’t help them to take care of their health. In order to cope up with such circumstances and to have a good health. Here are some of the top suggestions enlisted. No matter how busy you are, science has helped mankind in thousands of ways that are still taken for granted. To construe it up, there exists a rule of prioritizing your work. Firstly, accomplish your top three things mentioned in your to-do list. Secondly, take care about the outings you do. Make sure if enjoying a coffee with your friend is damn important rather working out. Still, if you can’t visit nearest gymnasium then ensure yourself to work-out at home. What it all takes is minimum ten minutes. Devoting four-four minutes to kettlebell exercises and abs work, and two minutes to squats and lunges are all what your body primarily needs. However, you can categorize these according to your most prioritized exercises that can heal you from stress. Activities like early morning walk, gardening, and swimming is the best criterion for your health. As far as healthy eating is concerned, be sure to cook in bulk so that they can be consumed 2-3 days if you are occupied. Tomatoes (good for your heart), spinach (good for your brain), blueberries (good for your cholesterol), salmon (good for weight loss) and pumpkin seeds (good for your memory) are all the required meals for your body fuels. Staying hydrated is yet, another plus point! </span>

                <p> Welcome to Wordophic! It is the brainchild of Adnan Khan and Eman Ahmad Shaikh which highlights different flavors of life. As far as its journey is concerned, Wordophic commenced when we identified the lack of space for writers and prosers
                    in publishing industry. "I once tried to publish a magazine but didn 't know the publication process." -Eman Ahmad Shaikh. This idea popped up the next significant step of Wordophic in mind. It took some days in research to grow Pakistan's
                    online ecosystem. Wordophic has dogged belief that the right to be published should not be fourwalled or limited upto certain writing topics but to be secular in writings. So the contents are written by our in-house team which showcases
                    its work and beget healthy discussions. Wordophic also helps students master public writing signature, building self-esteem and learn about literature and narration. . </p>
