    <a href="#">Workout for diabetics</a>
    <p>
        Diabetes has a couple of curing-tracks, be it either through nutrition or fitness. Throwing light on fitness, we have various exercises that a diabetic needs <span id="dots22">...</span>
        <span id="more22" style="display: none;">  to chase.<br>
        

            1.     The very foremost practice should be LISS from aerobics which is abbreviated as Low Intensity Steady State. LISS eases you with your workout as well as breathing mechanism; you can also talk to someone without running a shortage of oxygen. Such fat-burning exercise can be carried at long intervals i.e. 2-3 hours. It reduces your stress and strain due to lowering of cortisol level. Slow jogging, walking, or yoga also come along its way.<br>
            2.     Another athletic trick is anaerobic exercise such as running, jogging, playing outdoor games etc. Such exercises end up huffing and puffing. It is usually not recommended to diabetic (type 2), to old people and to those suffering cardiac troubles. Since it inclines stress, blood sugar, and insulin.<br>
            3.     HIIT (high intensity interval training) has further helped mankind. It should not be prolonged more than a minute. Thus one can carry it thrice a week.<br>
            4.     HIWT (high intensity weight training) has a law that one needs to weigh before a cardio walk. 10 REPS are enough for it. Weight training actually embodies muscle mass which increases BMR that further inclines output of calories.<br>
            5.     HIRT (high intensity resistance training) is another easy-peasy exercise. To carry this, you must recover your workout since it inclines your cortisol levels. It includes squats, pushups, and band bicep curls.
            It is important to avoid harsh exercises to avoid reinjuring the muscles and your joints. Consult your doctor in case of a severe immobility problem.  <br>
            Fittest of all individuals is going to thrive!

    <a href="#"> A diabetic as carefree even after cheat-meal</a>
    <p>
        It is noticed quite often that diabetics cheat their special dietary regime involuntarily either due to sugary cravings <span id="dots19">...</span>
        <span id="more19" style="display: none;">   or by having a heavy meal that abruptly needs to be purified and balanced. Otherwise, it can be troublesome and disgusting to the utmost degree for health. Just for the information; cheat meals are never bad for those doing keto, it only affects the sufferers of diabetes. Here we are with the schedule for diabetics who are feasible even if they cheat meals. <br>

            1.     Go for a water-fast immediately; no water, lemonade, tea, green tea, coffee, bone broth etc. for 24-36 hours.<br>
            
            2.     Consume protein and fat. Say no to carbohydrates and vegetables.<br>
            
            3.     Liver (mutton liver, chicken liver, etc.) is the best cope-up item to have in a meal.<br>
            
            4.     Taking fermented pickles, enriched with minerals and vitamins, is good for you.<br>
            
            5.     You can make your own keto-burger; add a kabab of beef or chicken with a slice of cheese and a leaf of iceberg over it.<br>
            
            Note: No bread/carbohydrate is allowed to have in it.<br>
            
            6.     Use pink Himalayan salt, nuts and pumpkin seeds.<br>
            
            7.     Have a green-leaf shake; add any leafy vegetable to your drink.<br>
            
            Note: Repeat the schedule for 3-4 days. And later, you are back to the normal routine.

        <span id="more13" style="display: none;">   of ulcers and lesions. Whereas, IBD is a chronic condition. An IBS patient suffers from food poisoning, constipation, gastric issues, nausea, vomiting, cramps and diarrhea. Additionally, food, stress or illness can also be factors of IBS. On the flip side, people who suffer from Inflammatory Bowel Disease face symptoms like ulcers and bleeding in the rectal portion, blocked bowels, bloody stools, extreme weight loss and anemia. There is no exact cure for such diseases, but they can be controlled with antibiotics, change in life-style or sometimes surgery (in IBD). However, pain can be felt in the whole abdominal region. A doctor can diagnose the kind of disorder due to specific localization of pain. For instance, pain in the lower-left region identifies IBS. While, left-sided pains are a definitive cause of ulcerative colitis (IBD).

    <a href="#"> The harmful effects of carbonated beverages</a>
    <p>
        Americans take about 13 billion gallons of fizzy drinks per year. Fizzy drinks can be taken temporarily as an alternative to water, but sodas typically contain carbon dioxide, sugar, phosphoric<span id="dots10">...</span>
        <span id="more10" style="display: none;">  and citric acid, sodium, and excess calories. These components harm the body by causing problems like dehydration (dry skin and acne), calcium depletion, weight gain, high blood sugar, dementia, strokes and depression that can further lead to health complications i.e., liver damage and aging. Beverages purely contain large amounts of sugars that are turned into fats in the body, leading to belly fat accumulation. Moreover, sodas contain no nutrients. Hence, they just contribute to unnecessary calories, and resist your body from regulating the number of calories you eat and burn. Excess sugars is the principal cause of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Sugary drinks also cause heart diseases and cancer. Likewise, postmenopausal women who are more likely to drink carbonated beverages can be prey to endometrial cancer. Besides, fizzy drinks are a disaster to your dental health and bones (gout; due to accumulation of uric acid crystals). To conclude, it is important to abandon these drinks as soon as possible as they are injurious to our health. Let’s give your body a chance to heal and detoxify. Eat healthy!

        Majority of people are facing the issue to supervise their health due to reasons that vary in tones. Either, they face the time shortage or their fragile imbalanced  <span id="dots2">...</span>
        <span id="more2" style="display: none;"> diet doesn’t help them to take care of their health. In order to cope up with such circumstances and to have a good health. Here are some of the top suggestions enlisted. No matter how busy you are, science has helped mankind in thousands of ways that are still taken for granted. To construe it up, there exists a rule of prioritizing your work. Firstly, accomplish your top three things mentioned in your to-do list. Secondly, take care about the outings you do. Make sure if enjoying a coffee with your friend is damn important rather working out. Still, if you can’t visit nearest gymnasium then ensure yourself to work-out at home. What it all takes is minimum ten minutes. Devoting four-four minutes to kettlebell exercises and abs work, and two minutes to squats and lunges are all what your body primarily needs. However, you can categorize these according to your most prioritized exercises that can heal you from stress. Activities like early morning walk, gardening, and swimming is the best criterion for your health. As far as healthy eating is concerned, be sure to cook in bulk so that they can be consumed 2-3 days if you are occupied. Tomatoes (good for your heart), spinach (good for your brain), blueberries (good for your cholesterol), salmon (good for weight loss) and pumpkin seeds (good for your memory) are all the required meals for your body fuels. Staying hydrated is yet, another plus point! </span>

        <span id="more1" style="display: none;"> This horn-like structure called nail, if defected, can indicate signs of sickness in an individual.

Additionally, lack of zinc, copper and iodine can lead to white dots and streaks on the nails. Crumbling yellow or black nails occur due to fungal infection. Furthermore, brittle nails result from lack of iron and beta-carotene. Pitted nails can be a cause of skin disorder, psoriasis, eczema, or arthritis.

                                Bodybuilding started with the world’s strongest man, Prussian Eugen Sandow (1867- 1925), who developed musculature for aesthetic purposes. Bodybuilding increases the muscle-mass                              <span id="dots">...</span>
                                <span id="more" style="display: none;"> , energizes the tissues, and modifies the muscle size and shape that is symmetrical and pleasing to the eye. This competitive activity makes bodybuilders to focus on hypertrophy, fat-loss and contest preparation. Bodybuilding is specialized for men and women according to their height, age, weight or body goal category. It comprises of ‘big three’ compound lifts – the squat, the bench, and the deadlift. Moreover, it signifies higher rep ranges for individual exercises, generally in 8-12 or 12-15 range are often performed in ‘superset’, where one exercise is immediately followed by another without a rest period. Cardio and diet also play a huge part in a bodybuilding program, as fat-loss and maintaining a lean physique are incredibly important. ȆSerious body building is a lifestyle requiring complete dedication, since what you eat and spend your time doing outside of the gym is equally important as the time you spend training!

    <a href="#"> Factors affecting aging</a>
    <p>
        Aging is the most anxiety-causing factor in adults of the present day. There are many factors affecting aging that briefly include water, food, sleep, functionality, mental state and unnecessary fears. Following<span id="dots12">...</span>
        <span id="more12" style="display: none;">    are the succinct descriptions of the factors:<br>
            1. Water is an essential element of life. It eradicates all the signs of dryness. Therefore, intake of water is inversely proportional to aging. The more the water is taken, the less it is susceptible to aging.<br>
            2. Food is fuel. To combat aging, one needs to regulate intake of three respective colors; green, yellow and white. Green color is an evidence of chlorophyll which is found in various fruits and vegetables. Yellow color presents food rich in enzymes and vitamin B complex, whereas white color resonates with an alkaline and fibre-rich diet.<br>
            3. Fitness is a part of relaxation and sleep. It is better not to sleep too much or too less, but it must be for 7-8 hours in accordance with nature's biological clock. Hence, lawbreaking (being a night owl or snoozing in day) is prohibited.<br>
            4. Make sure to exercise and to perform stretches so that activity of muscles does not fade away.<br>
            5. Mental state is always given a priority to maintain its fitness and proactivity. One needs to make sure about his healthy and peaceful mindset. Because, the one with depression and anxiety will be the worst culprit.<br>
            6. Lastly, but most importantly is the factor of not keeping unnatural fear of aging. It has been researched that the people who continuously fear about aging are usually the prey to it.<br>
            
            Enlisted above are the features of aging and we are in dire need of tips permitting us to enjoy teen-age once again. Therefore, we need to legalize healthy lifestyles, and to have benefits from natural sources.

    <a href="#"> Body posture: “Symbol of fitness”</a>
    <p>
        Fitness industry, comprising few pillars, is way so established in this era. One of these pillars is “Posture.” As the human body is perfectly designed and scheduled, yet <span id="dots17">...</span>
        <span id="more17" style="display: none;">    its maintenance is still our primary duty that is also a foundation of personality development. Consequently, let us have a look on the few central do’s and don’ts: <br>

            Do’s:<br>
            1. Sit straight!<br>
            2. It is necessary to strengthen up muscles especially, the spinal and abdominal muscles.<br>
            3.  Exercise; lay down on an object placed at your back just at the level of your navel, join your pinkies of hands just above your head and toes of your feet below.<br>
            4. Spine and lower back workouts will certainly let your joints thank you.<br>
            5. If you wear a bag, make sure to put the weight over both of your shoulders.<br>
            6. While using the screen, there should always be a 30cm distance between your eyes and the electronic object.<br>
            
            Don’ts:<br>
            1. Avoid a slouched posture as it crushes the nerve-endings.<br>
            2.  Refrain from hunch-posture that induces pressure on organs; disturbing normal working of heart, abdomen and limbs.<br>
            3. Desist from saggy position as it can distort internal organs from their origins.<br>
            4. Don’t lower your head while reading a book or using a phone.<br>
            5. While using the keyboard of your system, make sure not to tilt your 90 degree angle of hands.<br>
            6. Do not lean over the steering while driving. Instead, pull your seat towards it and drive with ease.

    <a href="#"> Exertion shouts out loud</a>
    <p>
        Physical exertion means an effort to pull, push or lift a body part or any object in order to strengthen muscles. As activity of muscles fades away if, somehow, <span id="dots16">...</span>
        <span id="more16" style="display: none;">   they are no longer brought in workouts. Thus, physical exertion is of great importance since it helps against aging, and preserves bone density. Exertion also creates antibodies against several chronic diseases and improves sleep schedules. Equally, the essence of functionality is directly proportional to fitness, therefore, patients of depression are always advised for the functional exercises so that their bodies could perform at a metabolically active rate. Moreover, exertion has an endless list of health benefits. It ensures the quality of life for diversity of people pursuing little to no effort, or hard climbing exercises. Briefly, for the people who are not fascinated by exercises can spare some time for no effort-exercises like controlled breathing through the nose, talking freely and comfortably, taking breaks while talking and so on.

                <p> Welcome to Wordophic! It is the brainchild of Adnan Khan and Eman Ahmad Shaikh which highlights different flavors of life. As far as its journey is concerned, Wordophic commenced when we identified the lack of space for writers and prosers
                    in publishing industry. "I once tried to publish a magazine but didn 't know the publication process." -Eman Ahmad Shaikh. This idea popped up the next significant step of Wordophic in mind. It took some days in research to grow Pakistan's
                    online ecosystem. Wordophic has dogged belief that the right to be published should not be fourwalled or limited upto certain writing topics but to be secular in writings. So the contents are written by our in-house team which showcases
                    its work and beget healthy discussions. Wordophic also helps students master public writing signature, building self-esteem and learn about literature and narration. . </p>
