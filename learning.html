    <a href="#">   Sleep is the savior</a>
    <p>
        Sleep is the most important factor in one’s life that can either repair or devastate mental health. Sleeping is as vital for humans as fuel for the cars. There are<span id="dots31">...</span>
        <span id="more31" style="display: none;">   numerous benefits of sleeping and waking on time while acknowledging the balance of the biological clock. We have always been taught to sleep earlier so that we could enjoy the glorious beauty of nature by rising early in the morning. This statement proves to be right in such a way that one can ameliorate his cardiac health and pursue the recess time needed by the body organs so as to get refreshed by going early to bed. By the same token, your brain prepares itself by categorizing the current files into conscious or subconscious levels so that it could work on new tasks. This also strengthens your mental health. Therefore, it is better not to disturb your cycle of 6 to 8 hours. Otherwise, your body becomes more susceptible to certain diseases like diabetes, cardiac problems, depression, high blood pressure, stroke, aging, dementia, slow healing process. Hence, it is factual to say that sleep is your savior!

                                    Man is a product of information stored in his genes. Our genotype defines our core characteristics that we have no ability to alter. On the <span id="dots32">...</span>
                                    <span id="more32" style="display: none;"> flip side, our apparent bodily traits that may
                                        be influenced by the nature and nurture is what we call phenotype.
                                        A great person is neither he, who defines himself by his materialistic wealth. Nor
                                        he, who compares himself with the others. But the one who has great sense of vision.
                                        Thus, greatness is not specific or limited to anyone
                                        but occupies a commonplace for all. Because all are blessed with potentials and
                                        instincts that could be best utilized via gratitude. If you have nothing to be
                                        grateful for, just feel the heartbeat. What is it? It is life.

                                        feeling is absolutely mesmerizing! So let’s inquire about the steps towards
                                        greatness. Answer is, it begins when you transform yourself
                                        from animalhood to manhood.</span>

    <a href="#"> An ideal morning regime</a>
    <p>
        It is always important to sleep at the right time and begin your day with enthusiasm and deep motivation. Try getting seven to eight hours of sleep at night. Addict yourself <span id="dots18">...</span>
        <span id="more18" style="display: none;"> to getting up as soon as your alarm goes off.  There is truly no sound worse than an alarm clock. When you hit the snooze button and wake up ten to twenty minutes later, you disturb your sleep-wake cycle which makes you disoriented. Besides, exposing yourself to sunlight exactly after you open your eyes is barely tough. Yet, it is important to permit your body for efficient functioning like activating hormones and promoting digestion, knowing that it is day time. Otherwise, it disturbs your natural cycle of the body. Drink a glass of luke-warm water exactly after you rise and shine so that you could have smooth digestion throughout the day. It flushes toxins from your gut, and burns more calories throughout the day. Hence, it helps you to lose weight. It can be even more efficient if you squeeze a lemon in the cup of water that makes you a little fuller, preventing you from taking a heavy breakfast. Furthermore, research shows that drinking more water can help you fight chronic kidney diseases and other bodily issues. Overall, the more water you drink, the more effectively your body functions. In addition, start your day with a mobilizing exercise which can warm you up, as it is obviously a great way for warming up and lubricating your joints. It is always better to have a more nutritious breakfast rather than sweet treats. Adding fruits to your bowl of Oats (being rich in proteins, vitamins, minerals and complex carbohydrates) will always help your body in a healthy digestion process as oats keep your blood-sugar level steady. Thus, you can apt for fruits like blueberries, raspberries and strawberries, as they are less in sugar than other fruits, and rich in antioxidants. If you are less likely to have sweet breakfast, you can go for protein sources like egg and milk.

    <a href="#"> How to manage sleeping schedules</a>
    <p>
        Sleeping hours might vary from an hour to hour. Such differences of time can be regulated by practicing several enlisted activities.
        It can be harsh for you to<span id="dots34">...</span>
        <span id="more34" style="display: none;">   exactly maintain your sleep hours every day. Somehow, you need to show patience to yourself. For this, you can arrange the bedtime environment by switching off lights. It is necessarily important to avoid exertion when you are near to hit the hay as it will energize you, escaping from sleep. Another secret of supervising sleep hours (that are ultimately the fitness regulator) is to avoid intake of food. Besides the fact that the environment has a great impact, it is vital to eat early, exercise at daytime, and give a stimulus of sleep to your brain at night. This stimulus can opt any form like low light, relaxed body posture, and no noise. Likewise, the stimulus of sleep-time can also be any activity like reading a book daily in a relaxed-spine position before going to bed, and so on. These activities, when performed daily, will showcase your brain the time to have forty winks.

    <p>
        	POINTS OF POWER <br>
        •	Life presents everything to for you to choose what you love!<br> <span id="dots27">...</span>
        <span id="more27" style="display: none;"> •	If someone has something you want, be as excited as though you have it. If you feel love for it, you are bringing the same thing to you.<br>


            •	When you see the things you want, you are as the same frequency as those things.<br>
            
            
            •	Life’s catalogue contains the things you don’t love, so don’t choose them by giving bad feelings.<br>
            
            
            •	Turn away for the things you don’t love and don’t give them any feeling. Instead say yes when you see something you love.<br>
            
            
            •	The law of attraction is responding to your feelings! It’s only what you give that counts. The law of attraction – is the law of you.<br>
            
            
            •	Give judgement and criticism and you give it to yourself. Give love and appreciation to another person or anything, and you give it to yourself.<br>
            
            
            •	When people see a lack of anything, it’s simply a lack of love.<br>
            
            
            •	It’s your beliefs, true or untrue, that form your world.<br>
            
            
            
•	Your imagination is more real than the world you see, because the world you see comes from what you imagine and believe! What you believe and feel to be true is what will be your life.<br>


•	Whatever story you tell, whether good or bad, will be the story of your life. So start telling the story of your amazing life, and the law of attraction must make sure you receive it.<br>

    <a href="#"> EARLY BIRD OR NIGHT OWL?</a>
    <p>
        It is hard to keep pace with time as the immense work pressure of the current age keeps people occupied. Every “Lark” (person who is efficient in morning) and night owl has his own sleep schedule. <span id="dots8">...</span>
        <span id="more8" style="display: none;"> But due to the stroke of ill-luck, night owls have more chances to adopt serious health complications like diabetes, neurological, gastrointestinal and respiratory disorders. Moving onwards to whatsoever category you belong, always remember to enjoy your magical morning. Motivate yourself to accomplish those peak day tasks which you likely plan to do. It could simply be anything starting from reading a book or enjoying cup of tea. Another tip is to expose yourself to morning light as much as you can, since it plays biologically effective role via head-lighting your brain to start the day. Whatever is your current time for hitting the hay and getting up, don’t be harsh on it. What you need is just to advance 15 minutes early to your bedtime. Similarly, wake up 15 minutes before your normal time. Reducing this gradually is the best way to meet your ideal timings. An ideal sleep cycle maintenance is necessary as the recent research has indicated the risks of heart diseases occurring due to improper sleep-wake schedule. Therefore, form a schedule that fits your every day of the week. Variability of one hour is absorbable on Sundays. However, you can also have a dose of 30 minutes as your siesta time but don’t exceed the time. At nights, try avoiding the contact with electronic screens as they have blue light technology in them which disturbs melatonin. Remember, consistency is the key. Have you breakfast as the king and dinner as a slave.

                        We are always chasing gold – excellence – perfection – fantasy! We have this inherent need to show off our wealth to satiate our <span id="dots7">...</span>
                        <span id="more7" style="display: none;"> desires to feel superior to others because we have forgotten the ugly truth that one day all our wealth will bury in the dust. We need to spend money to create opportunities for others. But unfortunately, our entirely fake world coexists with hollow men who claim for manhood.
                
                            There are millions of people who don’t have clean water to drink and their living condition is a nightmare. On the flip side, there are masses living the life they desire. They get what they want, exactly as if the world is in their hands. In the first world countries, people worship things, shop lavish, they have big fancy houses, giving soul, mind and emotion to things. Together as a society, we have co-created sucked up world of materialism.
                            One day, all these materialistic things will be nothing other than the particle of dust!
                            
                            Our consciousness about dreaming fantasies will erode with the entangled worthless materialism of the world. We have just a short story of our remaining life left behind. We might become disappointed for what are we living over here, and for what we should be actually living for. We have been consumed with brand culture, new trends, and our obsessed souls. The level to which we are sucked in this materialism is nothing but appalling and shocking. It is time we serve the mother earth and practice gratitude.

        <span id="more6" style="display: none;"> personal values, his failures and distinctions, evils and humanities. As a matter of fact, each and every aspect of life correlated with society is coincident to your surroundings. It is the man who has to bond with society to keep a company that feeds the soul. Similarly, you are recognized by your company. A company, which determines your character, habits, lifestyle, and your personal achievements. It is as important factor as the brain of nervous system. Therefore, one should be wise enough to differentiate between right and wrong, truth and false, and sycophant and supercilious companies. Times change so do people, thus be witty while searching for your confidant. Someone can be inspiring by looks but a black hole by heart. At times, your social circle gives you fake pleasure but later you will thank your self-control. Because your company is the only soul of your body that can either please you with mental fitness or mental illness.  </i> </span>

        Life is primarily driven by your belief system. The positive thoughts bring positive experiences to one’s life, and <span id="dots5">...</span>
        <span id="more5" style="display: none;"> vice versa. The further subdivisions of law of attraction are the law of manifestation, magnetism, unwavering desire, delicate balance, harmony, right action and law of universal influence. It states that you will be attracted to the thing you chase, focus on and spend your energy with. The first and foremost thing you need to work with, is time. The more you spend, the wilder will be the results. With respect to psychology, it is called “Internal vs. External Locus of Control.” In other words, it is synonymous with, “you are what you think.” You will only attract to the positivity and productivity if you will focus on it. To construe it up, all you have to do is align your mind, thoughts and feelings for that specific thing. Have faith that you are going to achieve that so soon. Your high or low frequency is the foundation of your results which is a magnetic phenomenon because it is the only mind-body relation that works constantly.  </i> </span>

    <a href="#">Creative Writing</a>
    <p>
        Creative writing is an open art, never four-walled to academics or journalism. It is a <span id="dots4">...</span>
        <span id="more4" style="display: none;"> kind of polished talent that can take you to the heights of glory with due efforts. Creative writers usually begin from short story writing or simple poems to biographies and so on. But they end on their vivid destiny like screen or play writers. At first, content writers may face the mini-problems like vague topics of discussions and the chaotic challenges to begin the creative writing journey. To cope up with this, you can separate a jar, where you can put your chits in it. On those chits, you can write common names of topics like determination, passion, creativity, stress and tension, exercise and whatever topic that interests you. Whenever, you want to write, just pick up any one of those chits and start writing on that particular subject. Remember, your initial lines should be the introduction, middle ones about explanation and conclusion should always be at the end. Students can earn the fame and expertise at very young age, if they are proficient in English. They can also initiate by participating in co-curricular activities like publishing articles in magazines and newspapers. With enough time, you will be pro in writing. Lastly, it is important to have enough reading exposure to build a fine vocabulary to incorporate in your piece of writing.  </i> </span>

    <a href="#">How to improve your English language</a>
    <p>
        The impact of the most widely spoken and world-wide recognized language, English, cannot be denied in our lives. As we advance,   <span id="dots3">...</span>
        <span id="more3" style="display: none;"> we step into the corporate world of literature, science and technology, which is dominated by the west. Therefore, it is important to learn the basics of learning English. The most common problem encountered by us is that we know English, but we cannot understand native speakers sometimes, or we are unable to interact with them in a fluent way. Thus, we should work on improving our proficiency in English, the core of western world. If you are passionate, do not just try to read a lot. Because, you may not know the right pronunciation. In this case, listening to English will help you in unexpected ways, as you will learn the correct pronunciation of the words along with heaps of vocabulary that will enhance your fluency. Moreover, translating word to word in your mother language is also smart strategy to learn. Whereas, in regular verbose, it can erode away your interest from reading. You can also use 80/20 rule; 80% of speaking and listening whereas 20% of reading and writing. However, the ratio can vary to 20/80% in case if you are doing any academic research. The next thing is to make it simpler and easier. Do not involve too much in both; having fluency and an accurate grammar. Do not just overcomplicate. Just start speaking it with people, perhaps your friends and siblings. Watch Hollywood TV series and movies, listen to audio videos. And practice it at least 15 minutes every single day. And slow and steady, you will be a pro in English language. </i> </span>

                                Work is an exercise for body parts, either physically or mentally. The mental exercises help with the focused work rather than the diffused one. <span id="dots2">...</span>
                                <span id="more2" style="display: none;"> The tip number one to gain concentration for studying is to find pleasure in what you do, regardless of how hard that task is. You can also bring five times more attention to your challenge if you always find yourself at the same place (example, study table), and at the same time (i.e., 10 am everyday) for your study. Your to-do list should always be under your supervision. Cutting your accomplished task can help you in self-motivation. Prioritizing your tasks into categories (urgent : important, urgent : unimportant, not urgent : important and not urgent : unimportant) is also a good source for signifying what is better for you to complete first. Setting up a schedule for your duration of study should always be in your mind, e.g., 1 hour of study with a 5 minute break. This will help you focusing to the level-up. Moreover, staying hydrated and taking glucose-rich diet at breaks can strengthen your attention. Make sure if you are studying offline, then your distraction causing devices are far aside or turned off. Lastly, motivating background music can also help to concentrate better.</span>

            one’s nation would be extremely compromised. The global history is full of the names
            of the rising stars who were eminent pundits, poets,
            teachers, suffis and businesswomen exiling in their respective fields. Women have
            been illuminating their potentials since forever in the form of Hellen Keller,
            Benazir Bhutto or Margaret Thatcher. Currently, these
            beacons of hope are Hilary Clinton, Angelina Jolie, Malala Yousafzai, Oprah Winfrey,
            Jane Goodall, Beyonce, Jacinda Ardern and so on. Even in digital space, they have
            earned a significant place by becoming influencers,
            fashion-stylists, makeup artists, digital creators and bloggers. In retrospect, the
            nations can only prosper by ensuring gender equality and women rights irrespective
            of their ethnic, religious or societal details.

    <a href="#">We are more than our skin color</a>
    <p>
        Our everlasting lust for skin whiteness has originated from prehistoric colonial times. As a result, many individuals in our societies,<span id="dots16">...</span>
        <span id="more16" style="display: none;"> especially females, are fed with a burden of
            attaining white skin tone at the risk of identity crisis. To address our
            complex for darker skin, we have been advertising makeup products or cosmetics with
            an intention to lighten our original skin color. Is to remember that the brownness
            of our skin is a blessing in disguise as our melanin
            production is anatural process of shielding our skin. Each of us has been blessed
            with the best of our features. And as far as the makeup is concerned, it should only
            be done to enhance your features or modify our looks
            with elegance. To whiten the skin tone is a fallacy. Excess of anything is
            unnecessary and futile. Still, many of our beauty clinics and salons, including the
            skin-whitening industry, have overlooked this aspect. They prey
            on the insecurities of their customers, loot them and rob them of their identities.
            Therefore, it is important to teach our children that they are beautiful no matter
            what their skin color is. We have to create awareness
            on the concept of “being you.” So why should not we praise Almighty for what we are
            born with, rather than pretending to be what we are not!.</span>

                                There is a pressing need to educate masses regarding supporting small-scale businesses as they constitute a major share of the economy. Small <span id="dots">...</span>
                                <span id="more" style="display: none;">scale industries should be reinforced and
                                    promoted to encourage
                                    and financially support the businessmen to increase
                                    their productivity and help them expand their line of work. This way, the market
                                    remains regulated and
                                    affordable for consumers belonging to each and every socioeconomic segment.

                                    have to work harder to attain limelight and grab audience in the market. The
                                    important thing is that
                                    unlike lavish designer brands that loot their clients at triple rates and preach an

                                    businesses charge way less and target a wider population. Let us all educate
                                    ourselves with the idea
                                    of simpler living and need-based worthwhile shopping experience that benefits not

    <a href="#"> Grammar: The gateway to English</a>
    <p>
        English grammar is another core-part of the language besides literature. Normally, it is observed that we pay heed to the speaking skills like fluency, vast diction <span id="dots14">...</span>
        <span id="more14" style="display: none;">   and verbose etc. Whereas, the grammar is usually not stressed upon enough. While writing and speaking, grammar always remains under observation of the checker or listener.  It has a vast syllabi composed of parts of speech, tenses, punctuation, idioms, pair of words and much more which majority of us knows and wants to learn further. But the point of fact is that all of this knowledge is now a part of our subconscious brain. Thus, it is true to say that knowing is never enough, but practicing is. Accordingly, in order to practice English grammar you can purchase a grammar book and spare a minimum half hour to work on grammar on a daily basis. Additionally, in the era of today, you can seek training on YouTube or from various online platforms under kind supervision of coaches. Additionally, it is important to note that never fear making mistakes. Being a beginner you have certainly the right to make mistakes and rectify them. As practice makes the man perfect, so it is important to stay consistent to your learning schedules!

    <a href="#"> Hour of need for skills</a>
    <p>
        Skills are the need to survive in this technologically fast 21st century. As far as academics are concerned, there are vast fields providing massive scopes and applications, <span id="dots13">...</span>
        <span id="more13" style="display: none;">  popping up in the brains of the youth. Students have to work hard several years to enter their professional life to struggle for bread and butter. Hence, while paying heed to the poverty, we observe; there are many people who cannot complete their education due to the meagre amount of money they possess. Likewise, we come to know about the enthusiastic youth who want to have financial independence. Correspondingly, many females are stepping up to claim their financial stability. In other cases, many parents do not afford to pay the large sum of educational dues, hence hindering the never-ending schooling process of their children.
            Moreover, in the present age of inflation, there is a rapid-fire race of finance. Majority of people cannot earn and are prey to instability and dimmer life.
            As a result, a question pops in our minds, what can be that only source that can take their peaceful dreams to the heights of glory?
            The dignified answer to the above question is ‘exploring skills.’ People who have skills are firm and steady. They have no fears of not getting a job, and hence, lack of earning, because they find peace and poise in their polished talents, skills and creativity. For sure, this is absolutely a great source to showcase talent and let the earning get steady. In a nutshell, the sooner the youth explore their inner-talent and get it polished, the more they would see the prospects of a brighter future.

        Sun is the main source of blue light. However, digital devices like mobiles, tablets, LEDs and other gadgets also emit blue light. Thus, it is everywhere. There are different advantages linked with the blue light, though,<span id="dots12">...</span>
        <span id="more12" style="display: none;">   the disadvantages are severe than the pros. Notably, this type of light is associated with different physical and mental diseases. Since, eyes do not block the blue light, so it can cause cataracts, snow blindness, even cancer, permanent vision loss, eye strains and sleep discomfort. Additionally, it is bad to use digital gadgets at night, as they can be a culprit to your health, leading to diabetes, obesity and many other diseases. Yet, you can use blue light filters, or yellow tinted computer glasses to avoid affecting your health, while using digital devices for a long time. Moreover, take frequent breaks while using digital devices. Work with low brightness of screens at night to ensure a good night’s sleep.

        Acupuncture is a Chinese alternative medicine. It helps in physical and mental conditions, and activates natural-healing processes within the body. It is a technique through which needles are injected in the<span id="dots11">...</span>
        <span id="more11" style="display: none;">   skin. When the various pressure points on the skin are kept pressed, they induce relief to different parts of the body. Basically, the region you press is a pressure point of any organ or gland of the trunk. For instance, the thumbs of your feet are related to the pineal and pituitary glands. Similarly, each and every part of your hands and feet are associated with any organ or a part. Acupuncture gives relief from pain, inhibits stress-mechanisms and releases toxins. Therefore, it is necessary to drink a glass of water after practicing acupuncture. It will help in flushing out various toxins. Any dehydration-causing agent is its worst culprit. Correspondingly, one can perform it once in a day or so, depending upon the severity of the disease.

        <span id="more10" style="display: none;">   Above are the words often neglected nowadays. Today, many people don’t pay heed to the obligations inflicted upon them. To keep up with societal harmony, you need to make sure that you fulfill the rights of people around you. Do not overstrain your servants with the tasks if their health does not allow them to perform. Do not give them expired meals or damaged things to use. Treat them with kind words. Educate them about right and wrong. Because, a person doing your things, bound to your orders, is not your property but your obligation to take care of. If such ethics are not acted upon, it would make this world deprived of kindness and mercy. It is important to note that humanity is the essence of life. Thus, we should never violate someone’s rights.

        <span id="more9" style="display: none;">   new forms of trash composing face masks and disposables started accumulating after their disposal in the seas and oceans. Since then, the harms to marine life are increasing to the vast level. Many seagulls and fishes suffer from injuries when they unknowingly try to take that waste as food. It gets trapped around their legs, wings, and in throats of marine animals, ultimately leading to their death. Therefore, while throwing your face masks away in the bins, make sure to cut off their plastic straps (worn around ears). Additionally, wearing single-use plastic masks are not your savior against viruses. Switch to fabric/cloth masks which are ten times better for your health and safety measures.

                <h2>About us</h2>
                <p> Welcome to Wordophic! It is the brainchild of Adnan Khan and Eman Ahmad Shaikh which highlights different flavors of life. As far as its journey is concerned, Wordophic commenced when we identified the lack of space for writers and prosers
                    in publishing industry. "I once tried to publish a magazine but didn 't know the publication process." -Eman Ahmad Shaikh. This idea popped up the next significant step of Wordophic in mind. It took some days in research to grow Pakistan's
                    online ecosystem. Wordophic has dogged belief that the right to be published should not be fourwalled or limited upto certain writing topics but to be secular in writings. So the contents are written by our in-house team which showcases
                    its work and beget healthy discussions. Wordophic also helps students master public writing signature, building self-esteem and learn about literature and narration. . </p>
