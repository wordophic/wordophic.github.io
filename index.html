    <a href="#">TREAT YOUR FAILURE LIKE A SCIENTIST</a>
    <p>
        Be like a scientist in your life while dealing with failures. For most of us, failure represents who we

are as a person but for scientists, a negative result or failure <span id="dots105">...</span>
       

        <span id="more105" style="display: none;">  
            
             is not an indication of a bad scientist. The failures or setbacks are the data points that ultimately lead to the right answer. A failure proves to be an opportunity for growth intended for one reason that concludes to focus you on creating a new routine or understanding new agility. Failure is a result of an investigation. Let’s rewind from a failure for a moment. What was it that you were striving for when you felt you failed? An “A” in Physics?<br>

If you start viewing whatever it was that you were trying to achieve as an experiment, it takes the

pressure off of needing to have perfectly accomplished it. You attempted something for the very first time, regardless of how many years you studied, or

worked that whole journey was new to you, as it is the journey of life.

The gift with which you can bless yourself is to dig your failure for the next round.

Now you have gone through the experimenting process, and have come out on the other side as having fallen, what can you learn from it? Because I have a secret to share now, “That, failure is chock full of

knowledge that can help you do better in the next attempt.” This is the point of experiments in science.<br>

All results point to knowledge, the knowledge that scientists throw into their information bag to

use for their next experience. Every failure is an opportunity for us to drill the results for the value we can provide to do better the next time. Therefore, treat your failure like a scientist so that you can overcome it and treat it well.

    <a href="#">Common micronutrient deficiencies</a>
    <p>
        Do you have any white spots on your nails? If yes then it is a clear symptom that your body is craving zinc. This is the most common deficiency in people who binge on cakes,   <span id="dots104">...</span>

       

        <span id="more104" style="display: none;">  
            
             pastries, and other items made up of refined grains. Zinc is required for males as well as for females. In males, it plays a crucial role in testosterone production. Low testosterone levels lead to sexual immaturity, especially in pregnancy, the zinc deficiency dangerously affects the fetus and the mother. The best solution to prevent zinc deficiency problems is to cease the intake of bakery products and to increase seeds, nuts, lentils, and legumes.<br>

The deficiency of B vitamins is the most common deficiency that causes skin, hair, and digestive problems. Below are some common problems enlisted related to its particular cause that can help you identify the problem and its root cause.<br>

1.     Most of us have to deal with cracked corners of heels, bloodshot eyes, ulcers on lips, or cracked corners of the sides of the mouth. These symptoms indicate vitamin B2 deficiency.<br>

2.     Horizontal lines on your nails or wandering eyes indicate a deficiency of vitamin B1.<br>

3.     Rounded nails show a deficiency of vitamin B12.<br>
            
             4.     If you binge on poor choices of food like cakes, pizzas, fast foods, or even overly processed foods; redness around the nose, forehead, and cheeks develops and depicts an alarming symptom of vitamin B6 deficiency. <br>
             5.     Iron deficiency signs and symptoms show up when the sufferer has a pale face, white nails, and depigmentation of lips that is due to low iron and hemoglobin levels. Note that they both are inter-linked. Iron is essential for the production of blood. The best way to fulfill it is to start using iron karahi for cooking. Moreover, patients have to opt for red-colored fruits like beetroot or carrot maple.<br>
             6.     Another common symptom is having vertical ridges on nails, loss of eyebrows, or puffy eyes that indicate low thyroid. The thyroid hormone regulates your body’s metabolism. Since it gets disturbed, it can create further deficiencies in the body. As women have more hormonal events, they are prone to these symptoms. But do not blame hormones as they are all lifestyle-associated diseases.<br>

    <p>
        The human body is such a magnificent machine. When things go wrong it does not shut down without indicating signs, instead, it allows us to figure  <span id="dots103">...</span>

       

        <span id="more103" style="display: none;">  
            
             out the causes and suppress the ailment. In this article, we are going to throw light on the treatment of the signs indicated by our bodies.<br>

Do you feel a cracking sound when you bend your knees? If yes, this is a clear sign of calcium deficiency. The primary role of calcium is to maintain strong bones and teeth. Low levels of calcium can gradually lead to a condition called arthritis. On a good note, you do not need to invest in calcium supplements as naturopathy is itself the best treatment. Try to add milk and milk products along with peanut butter to your diet. The best trick that immediately works is adding a pinch of calcium carbonate in curd and having it regularly on an empty stomach. Stay consistent for two to three months.<br>

If you feel that your tongue is prone to ulcers and cuts, know that the body is deprived of vitamin C. Bleeding gums while brushing is the most common symptom of a disease called scurvy. What’s happening at the cellular level is that your arteries are bleeding which needs to get controlled urgently, in order not to let it aggravate and further lead to vascular diseases. The best way to include vitamin C is by adding Amla to your diet. Amla has different forms of existence that include powder, pickles, candy, or even boiled form. Whereas other optimally healthy sources include capsicum, guava, etc.<br>

Do you have weak brittle nails or do you suffer from peeling cuticles? If you are prey to dry hair or even premature hair fall, get your biotin checked. One of the common causes includes binge eating raw eggs daily. Raw eggs stimulate salmonella which creates an imbalanced digestive system. Biotin is made from certain friendly bacteria in the gut. Due to an imbalanced digestive system, biotin is not made sufficiently. The best way to increase biotin production in the body is to start consuming probiotics that are gut-friendly bacteria. Have curd on an empty stomach with one teaspoon of jaggery powder mixed in it. Some other good sources also include apple cider vinegar and pickles.<br>

Note that taking care of the human body is important as it is a cardinal rule of the survival of the fittest.

    <a href="#">Machine Learning Explained</a>
    <p>
        We use machine learning every day, probably without even knowing it. When you do a web search for the nearest Indian restaurant,  <span id="dots102">...</span>

        

        <span id="more102" style="display: none;">  
            
            
            
             it works so well to give you the names of a bunch of restaurants nearby your location. Behind the scenes, the machine learning algorithm of a search engine (Google, Baidu etc.) knows how to rank the web pages and give you an Indian restaurant at the top and not any Turkish or Spanish restaurants. Another example would be when you upload a group photo with friends to Instagram or Facebook and want to tag your friends in the photo so that they may see it, you are given tag suggestions of your friends’ accounts with higher accuracy. But at the back, it is their computer vision algorithm which recognizes the faces in the photo and matches it with the existing accounts of the respective people. Similarly, if you search for a gadget on Amazon and similar suggestions pop up in your Amazon account, under the hood is machine learning that recommends something you might like. If you ask Apple Siri or Google Assistant to write a message to your friend on your cell phone and the voice is converted to text, backstage is machine learning converting your natural language into text intelligently.<br>
Apart from the consumer applications, machine learning is paving its way into many different big companies and industrial applications, for example, machine learning is used to optimize wind turbine power regeneration to reduce climate change effects. In healthcare, it aids doctors in making accurate diagnoses. This all is machine learning which is the science of getting computers to learn without being explicitly programmed.<br>

                                                    <p>
                                                         Rice comes in different varieties like black, white, vanaspati, brown rice, etc. Brown rice is a staple food containing Mg, P, Se, thiamin, niacin, <span id="dots101">...</span>
                                                        <span id="more101" style="display: none;">

                                                            vitamin B6, fiber, and Mg. One cup of brown rice comprises 88% of the total Mg intake. It is high in fiber and is gluten-free.<br>

Mg helps in bone formation, regulation of blood pressure, prevention of gastrointestinal disorders, and aids in alleviating diabetes. Brown rice contains phytic acid which is a good antioxidant, and also some anti-cancer nutrients. The glycemic index of brown rice is as low as 50 which helps in reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes. It is also used as a substitute for rice and meals. Since brown rice only lacks the outermost layer called husk, the process of refining brown rice into white rice removes bran, bran dust, and husk, and you are left with the starch solely and a few trace nutrients. This process destroys 67% of vitamin B3, 8% of vitamin B1, 90% of vitamin B6, 50% of manganese, 50% of phosphorus, 60% of iron, 100 % of fiber, and 100% of essential fatty acids. The glycemic index of white rice is 80 which is detrimental to insulin resistance and increases the risk for type 2 diabetes. <br>
However, it is ok to eat white rice especially when you don’t have the option to go for the brown variety.

                                                         Have you ever experienced butterflies in the stomach in a state of nervousness? Well, that emanation of sensation depicts that the gut <span id="dots100">...</span>

                                                            and brain are connected, also known as the gut-brain axis. The enteric nervous system consists of 500 million neurons, the vagus nerve, and some chemicals called neurotransmitters that connect the gut to the brain. That is a reason why ENS is called the second brain.<br>

About 75% of immunity is produced in the gut. Apart from a wide range of functions, the human gut performs the most important one is the production of feel-good hormones. The gut is home to a wide range of bacteria which includes good and bad bacteria. About 85% is good bacteria whereas the rest of the 15% is bad bacteria. Good bacteria are also known as probiotics which defend the body and protect it, such as lactobacillus, yeast, and Bifidobacterium. Whereas bad bacteria multiply and harm the body such as E-coli and salmonella. Gut microbiota is composed of 90% of serotonin and dopamine. An increase in bad bacteria production imbalances the ratio and leads to autism, Crohn’s disease, cancer, and other disorders. To moderate the ratio, you need to add kimchi, sauerkraut, yogurt, buttermilk, natto, and kanji to your dietary regimen.

                                                    <a href="#"> How to overcome mindless eating?</a>
                                                    <p>
                                                         Over decades we have become disconnected from our healthy food regimen. We fuel up the body only to fill the void. This often is a leading cause of unhealthy binge eating, mindless eating, and other disorders. Thus, today  <span id="dots99">...</span>
                                                        <span id="more99" style="display: none;">

                                                            we are going to bring this discussion to the light to seek better connections with our food together.<br>

There are 6 tips to overcome mindless eating without falling off the track and sabotaging your efforts.<br>

1.      Express gratitude while eating and have your meal in peace, without distractions, especially from electronics.
This helps encourage a mindful eating pattern and connects us with the food. It also has a similar effect to the mind-muscle connection; the food can heal you where you need the most.<br>


2.      Ditch the word ‘healthy’ and replace it with ‘real’ food.
Eating healthy makes you demonize real food (the food we should be eating). Today, the food industry has become a million-dollar industry. They have introduced various food labels in the market that pleases the eyes of every buyer, robbing them of their health beneath the surface. Following are the most common misleading food labels:<br>
·       All-natural<br>
·       Sugar-free<br>
·       Immune boosters  <br>
Beware of the so-called marketed products and scan the ingredients thoroughly before any purchase.<br>

3.      Appreciate the nutritional value of food.
Think consciously about the organs that are being benefited by the meal you are having. Having a piece of emotional and spiritual information about each food is a bonus point!<br>
4.      Don’t buy things you’ll regret later.
One of the easiest ways to sabotage your health is to buy unproductive packaged foods that you know you do not have self-control over. Try to eat real food in its whole form and shop the produce section more than any other section in the grocery store.<br>
5.      Never grocery shop while hungry.
When you go too long without eating, you will start to crave unproductive foods, and it will make you put unproductive foods in your cart that you did not intend to buy. You will binge eat and regret the choices later.<br>

6.      Plant your food and watch it grow.
Even if you do not have access to the bigger ground, you can still grow sprouts and herbs indoors. Watching your garden grow is a soul-healing meditation. It adds a powerful value to food when it is being grown, harvested, and turned into a meal.

                                                         According to this hypothesis, people who live in an extra clean environment are not exposed to the infectious pathogens due to which they have improper development of immunity. Because <span id="dots98">...</span>
                                                        <span id="more98" style="display: none;">

                                                            they trigger cellular pathways that regulate immunity affecting immune response. It has been observed that countries having higher levels of sanitation are more likely to have autoimmune diseases due to a lack of an activated immune system. Autoimmune disease is the condition when the body starts defending itself from its tissues called autoantibodies (not against the foreign particles).<br>

It is well-known that pathogens stimulate the immune system. In normal conditions, helper T1 cells are activated to stimulate the production of cytokines against infectious pathogens. In contrast, when no pathogen is noticed, decreased levels of helper T1 cell production take place, and in return, helper T cells 2 are produced. Higher T2 levels further result in allergic disorders like asthma, food allergies, etc. But it is important to note that exposure to only some pathogens can stimulate the immune system, other pathogens can have a negative effect. Also, the human microbe (the microbes in and on us) play a significant role in immunity. This microbiome is regulated by many factors, like diet and antibiotic overuse, which are unrelated to hygiene.<br>

Being said, the hygiene hypothesis can also be a factor contributing to a weakened defense system. It is critical to consider that being unhygienic is also not a better option. We just need to evaluate the balance and take care of ourselves, knowing that excess of anything is bad.

                                                    <p>
                                                         These days fluoride has been consumed through almost every possible source. It is found in fluoridated water, salt, and fluoride supplements. Furthermore, the dental care products in the market like tubes of toothpaste <span id="dots97">...</span>
                                                        <span id="more97" style="display: none;">

                                                            and mouth rinses are the most detrimental fluoride products. Some minor sources of fluoride might be seafood, some fruits, and vegetables.   Although fluoride is naturally occurring, there are some side effects of fluoride that are harmful to health. Some of the potential downsides are listed below.<br>

When fluoride is consumed in excess, skeletal and dental fluorosis takes place. Skeletal fluorosis is a bone disease characterized by the accumulation of fluoride in the bones. It can further lead to calcification of ligaments, and joint pain due to which the stiffness results.

Fluoride consumption leads to impaired brain development and cognitive functioning, especially in children. It happens when the pineal gland (the third eye) is inhibited to function due to exposure to high levels of fluoride. The suppressed pineal gland can not function in critical thinking.<br>

Mild dental fluorosis is characterized by white spots on teeth, otherwise, brown stains appear that are associated with the weakening of teeth.

Additionally, osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer has also been observed that affects the larger bones in the body.

                                                    <p>
                                                         Focus is a zone that catches most of your attention without any distraction. There are a few game-changer hacks that you could apply in your daily life to optimize <span id="dots96">...</span>
                                                        <span id="more96" style="display: none;">focus.
                                                            <br>
                                                            Let’s begin with the investment of energy firstly. If you have assigned yourself an important task, schedule it at the time of day when you have most of the energy to perform. It is important to be at a peak of your energy because managing time in better ways plays a crucial role. It is useless if you have time but don’t have the energy to do it. Many people consume their energy on their important tasks at the beginning of the day, whereas for some people it works the other way around. <br>
                                                            Secondly, do not use social media before the afternoon. It is the best way to eradicate distraction and pursue your agenda rather than scrolling aimlessly on social media and observing people’s agendas. We do not often realize that our physical energy is as important as our mental energy. And one favor that you could do to your mind is at least not dictating it to the mental state of the world.<br>
                                                            If you want to stay focused, do not catch up with the screen when you wake up. Another better option could also be leaving your phone in any other room till you get your work done.<br>
                                                            Moreover, provide yourself with an “anchor task” that is a mainstay and could make your day in place. The power of choosing one priority will guide you to make the way through the day. Because in the beginning, it is all about getting started, not even succeeding.

                                                    <p>
                                                        Nowadays political temperature in Pakistan is towering high. There is an air of uncertainty everywhere in the whole country. For the first time in the history of Pakistan, a no-confidence motion succeeded against the prime minister of Pakistan.<span id="dots95">...</span>
                                                        <span id="more95" style="display: none;">The PDM and PPP worked together to oust Imran Khan through a no-confidence motion. Approximately 20 MNAs of PTI were against Imran Khan, whereas the other members of PTI did not vote for Shahbaz Sharif as they could be disqualified. The Tehreeq-e-Insaf responded by accusing the opposition parties of being a part of the foreign-backed conspiracy, claiming that it possessed a diplomatic cable in which a threat was issued by the US Government to remove Imran Khan as Prime Minister of Pakistan, otherwise Pakistan had to face severe economic and geopolitical problems. Nevertheless, the US foreign office has denied such rumors. The national security committee also admitted that the letter contained "Undiplomatic Language", but they refused the impression of any foreign interference. In this raid, the Pakistani ambassador to America, belonging to no political party, has also claimed to have received threats. The Russian Foreign Minister's spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, reported that the US has punished the lawless Imran Khan which is a shameless act. Knowing this Imran khan called out his supporters to stage rallies and assemblages all over Pakistan. There was a huge crowd of people in Karachi, Lahore, and Peshawar. The hashtag "Imported government na Manzoor" is still trending on Twitter leaving a mark in history. The Twitter space of Imran Khan has also broken the records.<br>

After the removal of the previous government, Shahbaz Sharif took the place as the PM. Currently, the newly elected CM of Punjab has not taken oath yet. There is still an element of tension left in the political chambers of Pakistan. Dr. Arif Alvi who refused to take oath from the newly elected PM of the opposition is still the president of Pakistan. Legal experts say that it is not possible to remove the President from office because impeachment of the President requires a two-thirds majority of the total members of both houses of parliament. In this case, the President has no threat from the Government as the prime minister has no authority to remove the President. Throwing light on the constitutional power of the president, important decisions should be made suspending the rest of the affairs for a short period.  <br>

According to Barrister Salahuddin:<br>

"If the president starts refusing the advice of the PM, then the state machinery would quickly grind to that.”

Moreover, there is even an interesting situation in Punjab. There are decisions to be made yet. Let’s hope for the best.

                                                    <p>
                                                        Endorphins are one of the important pleasure hormones. A decreased number of endorphins induce laziness, addiction, sleepiness, and lethargy. Whereas an adequate number of endorphins help promote relief from pain, pleasure, sharper memory, a healthier immune system,<span id="dots94">...</span>
                                                        <span id="more94" style="display: none;">and better physical strength. A question arises, how to increase endorphins? Several ways help promote and maintain the levels of endorphins in the human body. Some of these are listed below:<br>

                                                            1.      Spending quality time or money, praising others, counting blessings, or improving a sense of security stimulate endorphins production.<br>
                                                            
                                                            2.      Natural food which is derived from mother earth like fruits and vegetables specifically bananas, or even dark chocolate also endorse levels of endorphins.<br>
                                                            
                                                            3.      Doing yoga or meditation, and positive affirmations produce endorphins. A 4-7-8-second technique can also help you with this. In this technique you need to inhale oxygen in 4 seconds, stop breathing for 7 seconds and then exhale carbon dioxide in 8 seconds. Or in other words; inhale oxygen in 4 parts, stop it for 7 seconds and expire carbon dioxide in 8 parts. Practicing meditation also helps in opening the third eye.<br>

                            <a href="#"> Power of thought</a>
                            <p>
                                It is said <i>“You are what you think!”.</i> Hence, your perception and attitude towards life define your 
ability to endure strength and achieve greatness in life, as author Tonny Robbins says, <span id="dots93">...</span>
                                <span id="more93" style="display: none;"><i>“The power 
                                    of positive thinking is the ability to generate a feeling of certainty in yourself when nothing in the 
                                    environment supports you.”</i> <br>
                                        Thoughts form our reality. The deeper you think, the more you awaken to find your meaning in 
life by learning to discipline your thoughts and achieving mindfulness. Thoughts determine who 
we aspire to be. They depict our soulful intentions and shadow our deepest desires. The raw 
thoughts popping in your mind are initially words without soul that may not make much sense, yet 
they possess immense potential to be transformed into reality. 95% of our life operates on the 
commands signalled by our brains, thereby suggesting the magnificent role of our thoughts in 
creating our reality. There are 50 trillion cells in the human body that work under the signals 
provided by our mind, and not our genes. Every cell is a battery and genes are just like blueprints. 
This complicated fashion of 50 trillion units of life give up their response and solely respond to 
the central voice of the mind. Thus, it is noteworthy to say that man is not a victim of genes but 
perception. With this potential that we are blessed with, we can serve others and help ourselves in
unique ways. A notable instance in this regard will be the recovery of one's health with just our 
positive and healing thoughts and practices like meditation. 95% of cancer cases do not contain 
mutant genes, rather they develop just because of epigenetic/non genetic influences. That is why 
psychologists advise patients not to own disease and to reduce the amount of time that they talk 
about being ill. Therefore, refusal to allow illness a place in your consciousness generates thoughts 
that help to regain health. Our thoughts form the strongest neuromuscular coordination that results 
in physiological reactions by the body, hence triggering the hypothalamus to provoke the entire 
endocrine system. Joe Dispenza in his book entitled Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself: How 
to Lose Your Mind and Create a New One quotes, <i>“When feelings become the means of thinking, 
or if we cannot think greater than how we feel, we can never change. To change is to think greater 
than how we feel. To change is to act greater than the familiar feelings of the memorized self."</i> <br>
                                    
                                        The direct connection of mindset and body produces the outcome following the nature of stimuli 
                                        that it receives. If the perception is positive and the person believes its healing power even if he is 
                                        provided with a sugar pill (Placebo effect) as a dose of medicine; he ends up curing himself. It 
                                        construes that it was not a pill that has healed him, but the thought-process that started abrupt 
                                        recovery. In the same context, this positive mindset empowers a strong sense of wellbeing and 
                                        mental vitality. A few of the key factors that regulate the positive belief system include kindness, 
                                        gratitude, spirituality, zest, hope, generosity, curiosity, and forgiveness. Your thoughts mold into 
                                        your actions. With time and consistency, these actions ultimately manifest as habits. It is often 
                                        seen in professional life when a person's optimistic attitude positively influences the job as 
                                        compared to those possessing pessimistic mind traits. Negative thinking can do anything from doubt 
                                        to limiting belief and act as a poison, commonly referred to as the Nocebo effect. Similarly, fear-based thoughts secrete certain glands and raise the level of cortisol, heartbeat and breathing rate 
                                        while imposing a negative effect on immunity. This is how the biology of belief-set has a direct 
                                        link with the human body. In the words of Bruce Lipton, <i>“The moment you change your perception 
                                        is the moment you change your chemistry.”</i> Your infrequent habits transform into your frequent 
                                        character. According to Einstein, <i>“The world we have created today is because of thinking.”</i>
                                        Today's business market is evidence of how there is an increase in profits for the marketers who 
                                        are firmly determined. Likewise, research shows that progressive communities usually excel 
                                        because they have mentally and physically conditioned themselves in such a manner. In his book 
                                        Power of Now, author Eckhart Tolle also stresses on the mindfulness of the present moment and 
                                        its perks. Our thoughts are dependent on various factors like surroundings, books, magazines, 
                                        social media, company and social circles because everything that surrounds humans becomes a 
                                        source of reference. Consider if someone tells you to close your eyes and that they are going to 
                                        give you a big juicy yellow lemon, you will observe how instantly saliva starts producing in your 
                                        mouth. It is believed that “You become what you behold!”. Our thoughts and intentions create our 
                                        reality that becomes our lifestyle.<br>

                                    
                                    In The Power by writer Rhonda Byrne reflects on our firm beliefs and their role in fashioning our 
identity. The significance of the power of mind over matter and how people can become healthy 
or sick is based largely on the state of mind. It helps you to explore the known and unknown 
corners of your mystical glory i.e. your absolute destiny. Destiny is life! Thus, the takeaway 
is that your journey begins with just a thought. It is your thought process that manufactures your 
mentality, spirit of life, and subsequently defines your journey in life. Thus, think good to have a 
fortune that traces your eloquence and positivity in life. Remember that you have the power of 
potential. Your thoughts construct your destiny and you just become what you think. As it is well 
said that it is your beliefs, true or untrue, that form your world because imagination is more real 
than the world you see, and the world you see reflects on your thoughts What you believe and feel 
to be true is what your life will be. On the contrary, fear is the most disintegrating enemy of human 
personality and in current times, anxiety is the great modern plague. Therefore, keeping yourself 
calm is the need of the hour for people to grow. For every problem there is a solution, so do not 
think you're the atlas carrying the world on your shoulders. Learn to re-program your mind into 
thinking positive at all times, in all situations.

                                        PCOS is a polycystic ovarian syndrome that every 7 out of 10 women are diagnosed with. It usually occurs in the reproductive years of the <span id="dots92">...</span>

Some of the symptoms women suffer during this period are; acne, excessive hair growth, and most importantly irregular periods. The prevention and maintenance include weight loss,as it can prevent insulin production, cholesterol disorders, hypertension, cardiac problems and type 2 diabetes. This hormonal endocrine disorder mismanages the hormonal balance. Excess of insulin due to insulin resistance in the body causes disruption in ovulation leading to abnormal menstrual cycle. Some other symptoms include excessive androgen levels, sleep apnea, and high stress levels. high blood pressure, oily skin, and dandruff or dark patches of skin, fatigue, female pattern balding, pelvic pain, depression and anxiety and decreased libido. Though, if left untreated it can lead to infertility, whereas women who conceive with PCOS encounter problems like miscarriage, premature birth and etc. As far as the treatment is concerned, there is no proper recovery other than the maintenance through some birth control pills, diabetes and fertility medications, and pills to control acne. But on a good note, diet plays a crucial role and dietary patterns should be followed strictly.

                                            <br> <b>1.   A    low glycemic index (GI) diet:</b> The body digests foods with a low GI more slowly, meaning they do not cause insulin levels to rise as much or as quickly as other foods, such as some carbohydrates. Foods in a low GI diet include whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, fruits, starchy vegetables, and other unprocessed, low-carbohydrate foods.
                                        
                                           <br><b>2. An anti-inflammatory diet:</b> Anti-inflammatory foods, such as berries, fatty fish, leafy greens, and extra virgin olive oil, may reduce inflammation-related symptoms, such as fatigue.
    
                                        <br> <b>3 The DASH diet:</b> Doctors often recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet to reduce the risk or impact of heart disease. It may also help manage PCOS symptoms. A DASH diet is rich in fish, poultry, fruits, and vegetables.

UV light has also shown to reduce blood pressure, to increase the efficiency of the heart, to improve metabolism and weight loss, to improve hormonal profile as well as the gut microbiome with increase in libido. A recent study in cell proves that exposure to UV light stimulates testosterone levels. Sunny days anywhere have a profound effect on mood and fertility due to the brightness, whereas those who don’t get into this brightness are caught with more incidences of fatigue, sickness, insomnia, and depression leading to suicide. Since UV light is the brightest, it was used to treat deficiency of libido in men as per recent research.<br>

                                                            If we want to restore health and humanity, we need to restore our relation with the sun. I believe we need an RDA for it.<br>
                                                            
                                                            BONUS: Stop staring at the screens all day and sitting indoors under the fake light and expose your skin to the sunlight as much as you can.

    <a href="#"> Learning, unlearning and relearning</a>
    <p>
        Learning, unlearning, relearning is significantly important, as the one who has been well-reputed in academics is not illiterate but the one who <span id="dots90">...</span>
        <span id="more90" style="display: none;">cannot distinguish the facts and figures from unreal knowledge or beliefs. It is one of the best methodologies that nourish the ideology and let it flourish with a fast pace to have a practical approach.
            Of course whenever we take interest in learning something new, gathering knowledge becomes pleasurable most of the time over a specific subject and we tend to make more of our time. This is called learning.
            
            Similarly when setting on a journey of accumulating information regarding subjects to be explored, one comes across various stages as some of its details may sound Greek, others might be logical thus easier to engulf and retain. Right here, a flexible mindset seems to be appealing as the particulars that are not hands-on. These may include unconscious beliefs, assumptions, practices, values that need to be eradicated. People usually lack courage to accept the change and let their philosophies be improved.
            
            Annihilation of beliefs gives rise to new, fine and precise alternatives that were looked for by a quester. Seekers usually consider this stage fruitful since they meet the logic and precise reasoning. Coming to an end, the world direly needs people who think critically, relearn their perspective and develop better conception.

    <a href="#"> 7 strategies to retain more of every book you read</a>
    <p>
        Whenever you learn something new your brain upgrades the software. Similarly when it comes to reading and extracting knowledge from a book, we must know that outcome <span id="dots89">...</span>
        <span id="more89" style="display: none;"> should be the bulk of information rather than quantitative analysis, because learning new things is not complex but retaining knowledge is. With this mindset let us have a look on an abstract below:<br>


            Skim through the table of contents, index, headings, subheadings, bolded points and within a few minutes you will know the ideology of the book. If it suits your interest then go ahead with it, otherwise it is time to look for the next read. This is a crucial yet important step.<br>
            
            Practice plays an important role in memory development. Make sure you apply knowledge in your daily life whatever you scrutinize from books. Of course, not every book is practical but those which are relatable should be put into use meaningfully.<br>
            
            You should make searchable notes either in digital or analogue format that is easily accessible when needed, because ideas are only useful when you can find it when you need it.<br>
            
            As Charlie Munger says, “If you get into the mental habit of relating what you’re reading to the basic structure of the underlying ideas being demonstrated, you gradually accumulate some wisdom.” Form the linking system between your old and new ideas on the relatable subject. It helps to retain more information and gather knowledge.<br>
            
            Conclude your read into a hand-written summary. Write about the core points, central ideas by the author, also do not forget to pen down your image if you find yourself picturing yourself in your read.<br>
            
            You can also apply the Feynman technique; write the name of the book at the top of a blank sheet of paper, then write down how you’d explain the book to someone who had never heard of it. If you do not feel confident while describing, go back to the notes or pages of the book and then write again.<br>
            
            Good books are not one-time-read. Read them frequently, or at least twice to retain more of it.<br>
            
            HAPPY READING!

    <a href="#"> MATERIALISM</a>
    <p>
        We are always chasing gold – excellence – perfection – fantasy! We have this inherent need to show off our wealth to satiate our <span id="dots25">...</span>
        <span id="more25" style="display: none;"> desires to feel superior to others because we have forgotten the ugly truth that one day all our wealth will bury in the dust. We need to spend money to create opportunities for others. But unfortunately, our entirely fake world coexists with hollow men who claim for manhood.

            There are millions of people who don’t have clean water to drink and their living condition is a nightmare. On the flip side, there are masses living the life they desire. They get what they want, exactly as if the world is in their hands. In the first world countries, people worship things, shop lavish, they have big fancy houses, giving soul, mind and emotion to things. Together as a society, we have co-created sucked up world of materialism.
            One day, all these materialistic things will be nothing other than the particle of dust!
            
            Our consciousness about dreaming fantasies will erode with the entangled worthless materialism of the world. We have just a short story of our remaining life left behind. We might become disappointed for what are we living over here, and for what we should be actually living for. We have been consumed with brand culture, new trends, and our obsessed souls. The level to which we are sucked in this materialism is nothing but appalling and shocking. It is time we serve the mother earth and practice gratitude.

    <a href="#">Perception controls life</a>
    <p>
        Everybody has the power of imagination. Your thoughts behold reality and your reality determines your destiny. As you dive deeper <span id="dots1">...</span>
        <span id="more1" style="display: none;"> into the roots of law of attraction, you
            realize that your perception derives your genetic code, thereby controlling your
            life. No two witted people can see the world in the same way. Their perceptions can
            be accurate or inaccurate, authentic or unauthentic, thus it is more on target to
            say that belief controls biology. Your beliefs create
            your life. As it is said that: “You create everything that happens to you.” –Jack
            Canfield People who passionately long for their dreams are the ones who transform
            them into reality. If you choose to be happy, you amplify
            your happiness and vibrate at such a frequency that generates influence on the
            people around you with your happy aura. On the flip side, obsessing on the negative
            energies ultimately constructs sickness or a gloomy world
            for you. Your belief is the only thing that works on the inside and on the outside.
            Hence, it is suffice to say that you are not the victim of your genetics. You are
            responsible for what unfolds in your life.</span>

    <a href="#"> Lack of sleep, its effects and treatment</a>
    <p>
        There is a connection between a lack of sleep and anxiety. A good night’s sleep can make a person feel energized and focused and give them an overall sense of well-being. But those<span id="dots88">...</span>
        <span id="more88" style="display: none;">    who have difficulty sleeping may feel anxious and face concentration problems. Research shows that using social media at night increases anxiety as well as feelings of depression and low self-esteem. Sleep-deprived state can further lead to mental and emotional disorders. You may start having hallucinations or experiencing microsleep (when you fall asleep for few seconds to few minutes, without even realizing it). Additionally our eyes also perceive the bright light of day and the darkness of night. As darkness sets in, the body’s biological clock instructs the cells to slow down. When the evening becomes dark, the hormone melatonin starts to rise and allows sleep to occur. Melatonin peaks around 2–4 A.M. and then reduces by morning, allowing wakefulness. This is a bio-clock fixed in our bodies, medically called circadian rhythm. Having unhealthful sleep habits may disrupt the circadian clock across the day. This may include issues such as:<br>
            ·       Going out late and waking up early<br>

·       Having no set sleep time<br>

·       Eating and drinking late at night<br>

·       Consuming caffeine late at night<br>

·       Using electronic devices late at night<br>

·       Performing mentally stimulating activities late in the day<br>

·       Having pain or discomfort in the sleeping space<br>

However, normal sleep hours vary from person to person; for children and infants it should be 11-17 hours, 7-9 hours for youngsters and adults, and 7-8 for older adults. Moreover, people who don’t expose themselves to sunlight suffer from low levels of melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep-wake cycle. Thus if you want a quality sleep, assess the importance of above principles as a medicine for cure.

    <a href="#"> Body posture: “Symbol of fitness”</a>
    <p>
        Fitness industry, comprising few pillars, is way so established in this era. One of these pillars is “Posture.” As the human body is perfectly designed and scheduled, yet <span id="dots62">...</span>
        <span id="more62" style="display: none;">    its maintenance is still our primary duty that is also a foundation of personality development. Consequently, let us have a look on the few central do’s and don’ts: <br>

            Do’s:<br>
            1. Sit straight!<br>
            2. It is necessary to strengthen up muscles especially, the spinal and abdominal muscles.<br>
            3.  Exercise; lay down on an object placed at your back just at the level of your navel, join your pinkies of hands just above your head and toes of your feet below.<br>
            4. Spine and lower back workouts will certainly let your joints thank you.<br>
            5. If you wear a bag, make sure to put the weight over both of your shoulders.<br>
            6. While using the screen, there should always be a 30cm distance between your eyes and the electronic object.<br>
            
            Don’ts:<br>
            1. Avoid a slouched posture as it crushes the nerve-endings.<br>
            2.  Refrain from hunch-posture that induces pressure on organs; disturbing normal working of heart, abdomen and limbs.<br>
            3. Desist from saggy position as it can distort internal organs from their origins.<br>
            4. Don’t lower your head while reading a book or using a phone.<br>
            5. While using the keyboard of your system, make sure not to tilt your 90 degree angle of hands.<br>
            6. Do not lean over the steering while driving. Instead, pull your seat towards it and drive with ease.

                <a href="#">Effective tips for studying smarter, not harder</a>
                <p>
                    Urging to work hard never guarantees scoring high GPAs. Studying smarter does! Adopt techniques to learn faster and better <br>


1.     Observe your primary channel that helps you assimilate information. It can be any of your basic senses. Your eyes or ears! Either you are visual and try to see information and get it right, using audio notes proves to be your savior, <span id="dots87">...</span>
                    <span id="more87" style="display: none;">or the writing notes/drawing/ highlighting/drawing flowcharts does.<br>

2.     Categorize your work into daily, weekly and monthly to-do lists.<br>

3.     Have handouts of ideas outlines of the topics provided to you by your teacher to Retain information. Do it while revising too. While studying, go through this scheme.<br>

4.     Print out presentation either printed or ppt form having every possible important fact. Have a look over the highlights/titles/topics so that you can easily figure out what you need to revise at the last moment.<br>

5.     People take notes. Explore what helps you either handwritten notes or typed notes and then printing them out.<br>

6.     Prioritize revising the information within the first 24 hours after hearing it. Remember we retain 80% of information in the brain at the moment, and revising after a week retains 100% of it.<br>

7.     You can lessen your curve of forgetting by reading from the textbook (within 24 hours), highlighting important points; rewriting them keeping in mind the textbook, Ppt presentation, and points from your lecture.<br>

8.     Skim! Extract important points in a shorter time by having a glance of chief words only.  Instance: reading introduction then first and last line of next paragraph, mid-lines of another paragraph and so on. Do not do this line to line. This trick works wonders in literature topics, academic journals, theories, .<br>

9.     Do not underestimate full-good quality sleep. If you are taking your exam in a state of dysania, your mind would probably not interpret information rather collapse.<br>

10.  Environment should be appealing and suitable and you should be alone while studying. It could be a neat and clean desk, nothing scattered or so. Other people can be messy creators, just know what works for you.<br>

11.  Watch what you are eating. Eating can nourish you but can make you sleepy. That is why people usually have their naps after they have meals. Accordingly, staying hungry is an important element. Empty stomach helps you concentrate and deliver better. Even if you snack first for studies then go for a break, have a meal, take tea, walk and study more! Do not do this in the same venue.

                        <p>
                            The changes in our health and genes which have been observed in the past years have eroded our fitness due to the unhealthy lifestyle, detrimental <span id="dots86">...</span>
                            <span id="more86" style="display: none;">food regime and so on. Such junk patterns lead to sugar levels and give rise to cardiovascular disorders, problems of the brain, PCOS, inflammation, cancer, male impotency, and liver diseases. The root-cause of all of these diseases is carbohydrates and sugar. It is an hour of need to admit carbohydrates as the enemy. Thus we are right to conclude that they cause insulin resistance which is the major cause of health penalties today. Many years ago, Prof. Jason Fung, a nephrologist, had alarmed the world that modern ailments will only be caused by diet. Nevertheless they will be 100% reversible too. To construe it up, diet is our only savior from the dreadful number of disorders that are inclining to alarming levels day by day. Just because of unhealthy dietary patterns we become prey to chronic kidney diseases, retinopathy, and amputation of toes, unhealthy cholesterol, and high blood pressure, neurodegenerative problems. Consequently, it is much necessary to acknowledge diet and to have check and balance of the kind of nutrients we are consuming. Consume good carbohydrates instead of bad ones!

    <a href="#">Supporting small-scale businesses</a>
    <p>
        There is a pressing need to educate masses regarding supporting small-scale businesses as they constitute a major share of the economy. Small <span id="dots">...</span>
        <span id="more" style="display: none;">scale industries should be reinforced and
            promoted to encourage and financially support the businessmen to increase
            their productivity and help them expand their line of work. This way, the market
            remains regulated and affordable for consumers belonging to each and every
            socioeconomic segment. Additionally, the stability of a local business
            is directly related with its reach, sales and profit earned. Initiating from the
            scratch, with limited resources and capital to sustain long-term, these businesses
            are more prone to collapse if not supported. Hence, they
            have to work harder to attain limelight and grab audience in the market. The
            important thing is that unlike lavish designer brands that loot their clients at
            triple rates and preach an extravagant lifestyle, small-scale
            businesses charge way less and target a wider population. Let us all educate
            ourselves with the idea of simpler living and need-based worthwhile shopping
            experience that benefits not only the clients, but facilitates the
            entrepreneurs to fuel up their business spaces.

    <p>
        

        It is observed that muscles get harsh on us after workouts. It is the evidence of any hard activity performed by muscles that screams now. Basically, it is known as

        <span id="dots84">...</span>
        <span id="more84" style="display: none;">  



            DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness). It is caused by tiny tears created in muscle fibers due to heavy duty. But then again, no worries! It is a gesture of fitness and accurate moves in workout, and it does not last long. In case it worsens, here we are with few tricks that are going to defend you against muscle soreness. Most primarily, one needs to be functional physically. This may seem like a fatigue especially when you want to cling the sofa all the time. But no biggie! You definitely need to devote your time to rest and relaxation beside workout. So that your muscles get set on to replenish and repair themselves, but make sure that they are in an elevated position. Pain remains in between 24-72 hours, ensure giving some heat via a heated towel or a pad to circulate blood. Or having a warm bath can also help you in this case. Try a massage or ice therapy to help muscles heal their wounds. For that regard, make sure to wrap ice in towel or in any other stuff. Then apply it for 20 minutes over the pain. However, it can also be treated by medications like aspirin, ibuprofen or naproxen. Besides, one needs to assure his healthy training by refraining from lifting an object that is too heavy or improper lifting styles, poor body posture, direct workouts without getting warmed-up, or overuse of a muscle. Last but not the least fact is that eccentric exercises take time from your muscles. Thus, do not rush straight towards heavy exercises.

    <a href="#">Cholesterol, the savior!</a>
    <p>
        

        Cholesterol-phobia had circulated all over the world in the old days. It has been considered a tocsin. Nonetheless, today with fast internet technology, it takes little effort to search the details and reveal secrets. Consequently<span id="dots83">...</span>
        <span id="more83" style="display: none;">  


            today we are going to debunk myths about cholesterol. Cholesterol was, and still it is, somewhat considered that it attacks the heart and blocks the blood vessels. But no! The major cause of this blockage is insulin resistance, instead of cholesterol. Before insulin resistance, arteries/veins suffer from inflammation, due to which cholesterol has to repair that part. There would be no life without cholesterol. It is a fat that our body makes 3000 mg per day. Secondly, each cell of our body contributes to making cholesterol each day. Thus, the more you consume good cholesterol the less the body has to make. <br>


Let’s further have a look on health benefits of cholesterol:<br>

1.  Primary constituent of cell membranes. <br>

2. 25% of cholesterol is synthesized by the brain. <br>

3. Helps in composition of hormones.<br>

4. Formation of bile.<br>

5. Used in vitamin D synthesis when exposed to sunlight.<br>

To conclude, it would be an illusion to consider cholesterol as health-penalty or that it blocks the blood vessels since it does not block them up, rather it repairs the injury that had occurred there. Likewise, it is necessarily important to assure whether the body is provided with HDL (good cholesterol) or not.

    <a href="#">Why say no to fast foods</a>
    <p>
        Heck, they are so darn delicious who says no! <br>

Fast food is highly processed having lots of carbohydrates, added sugars, unhealthy fats and preservatives. They have way too excessive calories but provide poor or little nutrition that leads to <span id="dots82">...</span>
        <span id="more82" style="display: none;">  

            all sorts of bad health outcomes. Most primarily, the poor integumentary system gets into trouble. Let’s say; acne, for which we need to blame white flour, sugar and carbohydrates. Such foods contain Trans fatty acids that are formed by hydrogenation of natural oils. They are detrimental to health as the recent studies have shown that the people who were living on fast edibles were more likely to have cardiovascular problems. Secondly, when you take lots of Sodium, it causes your body to retain water that further causes bloating. Fast foods not only have worse physical effects but it also causes declined-cognitive functioning. Since fast foods have no dietary fiber that assists intestines to lubricate the waste material, it leads to constipation. In addition to it, intake of fast foods is the worst culprit of diabetes and obesity due to the fact that they have plentiful amounts of calories. It can also put stress over the heart, leading to blood pressure and many other problems. You may have observed that post-fast-food effects include being lethargic or feeling of gastric acidity. Fast foods also lead to tooth decay. Risk of high blood pressure, cirrhosis, kidney stones, and bone weakening gets doubled. Recent research proves that fast foods contain phthalates which are harmful to hormones, thus getting the reproductive system into trouble due to ineffective hormonal production. Moreover, your cholesterol levels could also skyrocket. Lastly, it is too quick yet too environmentally unfriendly. Therefore let’s say no together before it collectively burns many lives

    <a href="#">Workout for diabetics</a>
    <p>
        Diabetes has a couple of curing-tracks, be it either through nutrition or fitness. Throwing light on fitness, we have various exercises that a diabetic needs <span id="dots81">...</span>
        <span id="more81" style="display: none;">  to chase.<br>
        

            1.     The very foremost practice should be LISS from aerobics which is abbreviated as Low Intensity Steady State. LISS eases you with your workout as well as breathing mechanism; you can also talk to someone without running a shortage of oxygen. Such fat-burning exercise can be carried at long intervals i.e. 2-3 hours. It reduces your stress and strain due to lowering of cortisol level. Slow jogging, walking, or yoga also come along its way.<br>
            2.     Another athletic trick is anaerobic exercise such as running, jogging, playing outdoor games etc. Such exercises end up huffing and puffing. It is usually not recommended to diabetic (type 2), to old people and to those suffering cardiac troubles. Since it inclines stress, blood sugar, and insulin.<br>
            3.     HIIT (high intensity interval training) has further helped mankind. It should not be prolonged more than a minute. Thus one can carry it thrice a week.<br>
            4.     HIWT (high intensity weight training) has a law that one needs to weigh before a cardio walk. 10 REPS are enough for it. Weight training actually embodies muscle mass which increases BMR that further inclines output of calories.<br>
            5.     HIRT (high intensity resistance training) is another easy-peasy exercise. To carry this, you must recover your workout since it inclines your cortisol levels. It includes squats, pushups, and band bicep curls.
            It is important to avoid harsh exercises to avoid reinjuring the muscles and your joints. Consult your doctor in case of a severe immobility problem.  <br>
            Fittest of all individuals is going to thrive!

                                <span id="more10" style="display: none;">  but possess immense potential to be transformed into reality. Your thoughts mould into your actions. And with time and consistency, these actions can ultimately manifested as habits. The more actions you do, the more habits you develop, hence transforming your infrequent habits into frequent character. This character ultimately becomes your identity and helps you explore known and the unknown corners of your mystical glory i.e. your absolute destiny. And what is this destiny? It is life!
                                    Thus, the takeaway is that your journey begins with just a thought. It is your thoughts that manufacture your mentality and spirit of life, and subsequently define your journey in life. Think good to have a fortune that traces your eloquence and positivity in life. Remember that you have the power of potential. Your thoughts construct your destiny because and you become what you think.</span>

    <a href="#">5 FAQs related to brain tumor </a>
    <p>
        1.     Is tumor a cancer? <br>
        All cancers are tumors but all tumors are not cancers. Tumor means abnormal  <span id="dots79">...</span>

        

        <span id="more79" style="display: none;">  
            
            growth that is either malignant or benign. Malignant tumor is cancerous. Another causing swellings on the forehead, arms, is the ordinary tumor. Malignant tumor invades other tissues locally and spreads onto distant places as well. Growth of tissue in the local area without destruction is a benign tumor. So one may not be afraid if they have a tumor that it is cancerous.<br>


            2.     What are the signs and symptoms of a tumor?<br>
            The signs and symptoms include formation of space forming lesions that exert pressure inside the head leading to the early morning headaches, vomiting (that relieves headache), dysfunction of the nerves that are having brain tumors; for instance, a tumor on auditory nerve may result in  hearing loss) leading to neurological deficit (abnormal function of the body area), seizures, etc.<br>
            3.     What leads to formation of a tumor?<br>
            Some tumors can be genetic, or formed due to exposure of radiation, whereas other causes may include neurofibromatosis. But many still do not have a proper cause. Syndromes are genetic, on the other hand, others are sporadic brain tumors that are without any particular reason.<br>
            4.     Is surgery the only source to escape?<br>
            Basically it requires scanning and imaging in order to be diagnosed. After proper diagnosis through CT scan and MRI, there are multiple options for treatments. If a tumor is benign or malignant with not more than 3cm is given a non-surgical treatment.<br>
            5.     What is stereotactic radiosurgery?<br>
            Non-surgical treatment is also known as radiosurgery in which focused radiations are thrown on the specific margins of the tumor without radiating the normal brain anatomy. Machines used for this purpose are known as CyberKnife, Gamma knife and the therapy is called stereotactic radiosurgery. They either vanish tumor or bring it under control for a long period of time.<br>


            Thus it is important to note that not all tumors require surgery or radiation.

    <a href="#">Food safety measures </a>
    <p>
        Food safety practices are crucially vital for our health and wellbeing. Improper food handling techniques give rise to food borne diseases due to which approximately 600 million  <span id="dots78">...</span>

            people suffer from foodborne diseases. The high risk individuals like babies, elderly, pregnant moms, immune-compromised, HIV, or cancer patients are more prone to such diseases which occur due to bacterial, viral or fungal attacks. These tiny prolific organisms proactively increase their number upon entering the body. These smallest, mysterious and energetic creatures belong to three different groups; the good ones - help to produce food and drink (cheese, yogurt, fermented meat, vegetables), less harmful ones - produce foul smell and taste bad but do not cause diseases, and the bad ones - this kind is horrifying type of deceitful creatures that may not smell or taste bad but are dangerous to our health. These pathogenic microorganisms cause severe illnesses like food poisoning, stomachache, nausea, diarrhea, and even death. But fortunately, no matter how terrifying their traits are, they are vulnerable and we can get rid of them by taking care of following precautions for safer food production:  <br>

            ·       High level of personal hygiene and practices like timely handwashing <br>
            ·       Better handling, preparation and storage of food

·       Keeping food clean to prevent contamination<br>

·       Proper cleaning and sanitizing of all surfaces of equipment and utensils<br>

·       Keeping food at safe temperatures either hot or cold to prevent bacterial growth<br>

·       Use of safe water and raw material to avoid contamination<br>

·       Separation of raw and cooked foods to avoid cross contamination<br>
·       Thorough cooking of food to kill microorganisms.<br>

We can protect our family and friends by implementing such preventive measures to ensure our health and safety or else we would have to pay additional costs of buying medications and checkups later. Therefore stay healthy, stay safe!

        Stimuli of emergency provokes stress as a response to the body. With its 3F power <span id="dots77">...</span>

            (fear, fight, and flight), it produces adrenaline; a hormone released from the sympathetic system, increasing cortisol levels. Contrary to it, the parasympathetic nervous system has 2R power (rest and relax/digest). As far as nowadays the situation is concerned, there’s constant hustle and bustle everywhere that has transformed our acute stress to chronic stress. It reveals that modern stress is indulged into every activity from rising early in the morning up to hitting the hay at night. This unstoppable exposure to stress produces adrenaline excessively which in turn increases cortisol, LDL, blood sugar, blood pressure, heart rate and breathing levels. That is why top-selling drugs currently are that of antidepressant drugs. Following are the only solutions that lie in living a simple treasurable life. <br>

            
            1.     Exercise daily for production of growth hormone.<br>
            
            2.     Practice yoga and meditation. <br>

3.     Have a full-night sleep. <br>

4.     Take a low sugar diet.<br>

5.     Spend time with family and old friends<br>
6.     Offer prayers and read the translation of the Quran.<br>

7.     Get into activities for charity.<br>

8.     Play with kids to combat the stress.<br>

9.     Celebrate events.<br>

10.  Develop early-to-bed and early rising habit.<br>

11.  Apt for long walks.<br>

Besides opting for new habits, challenging negativity and nellies, setting goals and getting in a routine is equally important. We must stay happy and live green so that we do not come in the list of stress-culprits

    <a href="#">4 ways to be ultra-productive</a>
    <p>
        How can you lift your productivity as exponential as 100 times? First thing that pops up in mind is the sense of capturing the criteria of people being creative and productive at the  <span id="dots76">...</span>

        

        <span id="more76" style="display: none;">  
            
            same time. Despite the era of digital distractions, psychology of procrastination and much more, the majority of us still strive for excellence. Excelling at this, we are with the following golden rules showing the bright side to us:<br>

            1.     Refrain from spending your finest hours of the day on distractions. Invest your time in what is worth working for. Here, Robin Sharma is of the view; “90/90/1 rule _ For the next 90 days, spend 90 minutes of your day on your single most important game changing opportunity.” If you begin devoting time to unimportant things in the beginning of the day, your performance, energy, willpower and focus would be all messed up, and you may miss out on a life changing move. Consequently, consume your most energetic morning hours at worthy pieces of work.<br>
            
            2.     Adapt the fine environment. Distractions like noise, or even toxic people are obstacles to your quality-work. Install environments of tight bubbles of focus where you are absolutely distraction-free. So that your brain could drop from the beta state that is fast, alert and attentive into the alpha state which is calm and stress-free.<br>
            
            3.     If you want to be a high performer populate yourself with a peer group who is doing great and is exactly where you see your future. Mirror neuron systems are naturally built-in humans that are indirectly related to the law of attraction. It models the behaviors, including the environment we live in, or the people we live with. Thus, if you spend most of your time with mediocre performers; your mind would subconsciously start pronouncing and behaving like them.<br>
            
            4.     Last but not the least is learning minimalism. You can reach an ultra-productive level while having a minimalistic mindset. As it is said that the secret to genius is not complexity but simplicity. History assures this fact greatly when iconic productivity comes to Picasso; a world class at just a few things. Thus, we can master our projects quite efficiently following the above golden principles.<br>

    <a href="#"> Three tips to transform complex brainy things into no-brainers</a>
    <p>
        Brain is a great organ, and has a super power. Intelligence of the brain <span id="dots73">...</span>
        <span id="more73" style="display: none;">   is elastic in nature that means the more you work on it, the sharper and stronger brain you will have! Our normal everyday tasks are no-brainer. Still, a little attention to the brain would prove irresistibly appealing. Here we are, with some brainy exercises which we need to normalize in our daily lives.<br>


            1.     Look around, observe the object that caught your attention at the first sight. Now you have 30 seconds to recall five synonyms for it. Pressurize your brain to think.<br><br>
            Ultimately, when the time would be over; you will observe a few new words that your mind consciously or unconsciously pronounced. That is an appealing way to boost your diction and to get rid of everyday-slang words. Practicing this over and over again would transform you into a smarter-being. Contrary to it, just in case if you could not spell the word out of your tongue, no worries, consult a dictionary on your phone and explore 5 new synonyms of the word. With the passage of time, your woke-up will grow. <br> <br>

            2.     Visualizing helps surprisingly when exercised time and again. For this, you need to write five random words. Now, work with them to connect with each other. <br> <br>

            Practicing it regularly will strain your brain to work more. To do so, it is even easier to manage a box full of numerous chits of words. Randomly pick 5 of them and start working to build scenarios, linking them up.<br><br>

            3.     Cannot you remember numbers? No worries! Solution goes with chunking. Chunk them up into smaller ones. Repeat them twice. And, you are good to remember lifetime.<br><br>
            It is always easier to digest little chunks than the bigger bites. Segregate long terms or digits into smaller sections. Repeat them twice and you are ready to spit them out anytime, anywhere.

    <a href="#"> A diabetic as carefree even after cheat-meal</a>
    <p>
        It is noticed quite often that diabetics cheat their special dietary regime involuntarily either due to sugary cravings <span id="dots72">...</span>
        <span id="more72" style="display: none;">   or by having a heavy meal that abruptly needs to be purified and balanced. Otherwise, it can be troublesome and disgusting to the utmost degree for health. Just for the information; cheat meals are never bad for those doing keto, it only affects the sufferers of diabetes. Here we are with the schedule for diabetics who are feasible even if they cheat meals. <br>

            1.     Go for a water-fast immediately; no water, lemonade, tea, green tea, coffee, bone broth etc. for 24-36 hours.<br>
            
            2.     Consume protein and fat. Say no to carbohydrates and vegetables.<br>
            
            3.     Liver (mutton liver, chicken liver, etc.) is the best cope-up item to have in a meal.<br>
            
            4.     Taking fermented pickles, enriched with minerals and vitamins, is good for you.<br>
            
            5.     You can make your own keto-burger; add a kabab of beef or chicken with a slice of cheese and a leaf of iceberg over it.<br>
            
            Note: No bread/carbohydrate is allowed to have in it.<br>
            
            6.     Use pink Himalayan salt, nuts and pumpkin seeds.<br>
            
            7.     Have a green-leaf shake; add any leafy vegetable to your drink.<br>
            
            Note: Repeat the schedule for 3-4 days. And later, you are back to the normal routine.

    <a href="#"> How to improve your eyesight and focus?</a>
    <p>
        People are gradually being aware of the eyes-exercises and have begun calling it a natural remedy to cure eyesight problems. If you are facing any problem of near-sightedness or far-sightedness, <span id="dots36">...</span>
        <span id="more36" style="display: none;">  cataracts, or macular-degeneration due to aging, then you are probably going to benefit from the following exercises: <br>

           1) Focus on your point finger a few inches away from your eyes and gradually increase the distance. Remember to keep focusing, and bring that finger slowly towards your eyes. Do it 3 times at least to improve your focus.<br>
            
           2) Create a pinhole with your finger and focus the images through it. This exercise will help you to strengthen your concentration.<br>
            
           3) Focus on your thumb ten-inches away from your eyes for 15 seconds. Then instantly find an object 10-15 feet away and focus on it. Repeat it five times.<br>
            
           4) Trace an imaginary figure 8 with your eyes on the floor. Let the distance be 10 feet. Practice it 30 times, constantly.<br>
            
           5) To cope up with eye-sight problems, the 20-20-20 rule is going to be your savior. Stare/focus on an object every 20 minutes at 20 feet away for 20 seconds.<br>
            
           6) Perform eye yoga frequently. Sit straight with your shoulders off. And rotate your eyes in a clockwise and anticlockwise direction. Remember not to abandon focus. Focus on the image along your direction and continue within the loop.<br>
            
           7) Blink your eyes slowly every time as it keeps moist and permits eligibility to focus longer.<br>
            
           8) Try to write on the walls rotating your lens along the direction of alphabets.<br>
            
           9) Palming your eyes is another efficient tip to relax your eyes. Put your light palms of both hands on your eyes and press them cordially with a light thrust.  <br>

                            We are more likely to place chicken on the top shelf of meals. Research shows <span id="dots71">...</span>
                            <span id="more71" style="display: none;">  that white meat, despite the fact that it has plenty of nutrients, can be the biggest cause of health concerns. First and foremost point to ponder is to limitize the quantity of its consumption. Overdose of chicken can lead to food poisoning and diarrhea. Cooking or grilling chicken induces a vast amount of carcinogens that can lead to cancer. Commercial poultry birds are a source of intestinal bacteria like Salmonella, E.coli, and Enterococcus etc. Genetically modified chicken has diverse elements in its fodder that are normally refrained in diets. Vets are usually given arsenic in their diet that is hazardous to cardiac and neurological health. They become a carrier of disease to its consumers and also cause obesity. It is important to acknowledge that commercial poultry breeds can highly risk your health, and can be cruel to your maintained-weight. In fact, free range desi can be the best choice as its alternative ever.

                                Lemon is a miraculous fruit with immense health benefits that cannot be taken for <span id="dots70">...</span>
                                <span id="more70" style="display: none;">  granted. It is quite acidic in nature with 2 pH value. The fruit, juice, and the peel itself is not only a catalyst to your health and beauty but it also works wonders as a medication. Lemon juice helps to diminish vitamin C deficiency. Due to its anti-inflammatory properties, it soothes your digestive and circulatory systems. Today, there exists a broad ideology for putting off weight, looking dapper and staying smart. Thus, this is no brainer to acknowledge lemon as a savior of life. Lemon adds grace to your life, but one better not directly apply to skin especially the facial skin since it can be reactive due to highly acidic nature. In that case, try using it with water to transform its pH value to little alkaline. Moreover, lemon proves to be beneficial to cardiac, renal, and digestive health. It controls weight, and assists the body to fulfill potassium and vitamin B6 requirements. Citrus limon also works miracles for anemia. Therefore, it is much needed to have some lemons at the dining table to let the body get a chance to nourish itself

    <a href="#"> Emotional eating</a>
    <p>
        The term ‘emotional eating’ implies mindless eating to primarily satisfy one’s emotions besides hunger. Behind this, are linked reasons like <span id="dots57">...</span>
        <span id="more57" style="display: none;">   relief, relaxation, or reward. One of the main symptoms includes opting junk food which is unhealthy, but at the same time, soothing. After overeating, it becomes a guilt of overdosing and not helping with discarding emotions anymore. Long story short, the problem remains unsolved and the cycle continues. Emotional eating can be controlled with practicing discipline and a healthy lifestyle. Such people, who often are guilty of such practice, need to pursue self-caring routines like regulated day and night schedules with structured eating and relaxing shifts. Additionally, the core of the problem lies in anxiety and stress, for which, the way out is to be easy with different circumstances to apparently gain limited pleasures.

    <a href="#"> Secrets of mindful eating</a>
    <p>
        Mindful eating is to feed your brain while you eat. Whatever the fuel you take into the body, it is not efficient or effective unless and until your brain does not concentrate on it. This  <span id="dots55">...</span>
        <span id="more55" style="display: none;">   practice is often neglected at times when we are in flurry, getting late to work or watching television, etc. Mindful eating is, in point of fact, the celebration of the joyful meal along with knowing the food patterns. These food patterns let you judge yourself about the quantity of food, binge eating, and disciplined food intake. Enlisted below are the few techniques to practice mindful eating:<br>
            1. Mindful eating is easier to practice per meal, either it can be breakfast, brunch, lunch or dinner time.<br>
            2. It is important to shut down all the screens or setting them at flight modes which develop your attention on food and you.<br>
            3. Remember, you are not eating food, rather feeling it. Thus, you need to set up the clock. Let’s say you can extract minimum 20 minutes for the mealtime, knowing that the time can exceed but not subceed.<br>
            4. Meal should be appreciated. Subsequently, you need to eat sluggishly and chew thoroughly as it will maintain your overall health and well-being.<br>
            5. Choose the daily-diary of food that are emotionally comforting and nutritionally healthy.<br>

    <a href="#"> Hour of need for skills</a>
    <p>
        Skills are the need to survive in this technologically fast 21st century. As far as academics are concerned, there are vast fields providing massive scopes and applications, <span id="dots54">...</span>
        <span id="more54" style="display: none;">  popping up in the brains of the youth. Students have to work hard several years to enter their professional life to struggle for bread and butter. Hence, while paying heed to the poverty, we observe; there are many people who cannot complete their education due to the meagre amount of money they possess. Likewise, we come to know about the enthusiastic youth who want to have financial independence. Correspondingly, many females are stepping up to claim their financial stability. In other cases, many parents do not afford to pay the large sum of educational dues, hence hindering the never-ending schooling process of their children.
            Moreover, in the present age of inflation, there is a rapid-fire race of finance. Majority of people cannot earn and are prey to instability and dimmer life.
            As a result, a question pops in our minds, what can be that only source that can take their peaceful dreams to the heights of glory?
            The dignified answer to the above question is ‘exploring skills.’ People who have skills are firm and steady. They have no fears of not getting a job, and hence, lack of earning, because they find peace and poise in their polished talents, skills and creativity. For sure, this is absolutely a great source to showcase talent and let the earning get steady. In a nutshell, the sooner the youth explore their inner-talent and get it polished, the more they would see the prospects of a brighter future.

    <a href="#"> Cross on forgetfulness</a>
    <p>
        Forgetfulness is the major hurdle for the man of today. We learn, we perform tasks, we workout, but eventually we forget, sometimes the most important things. We put <span id="dots53">...</span>
        <span id="more53" style="display: none;">  something somewhere and after a short span of time, we are again the victim of blunder headedness.
            As far as the term forgetfulness is concerned, a person can be a prey of it only in case of Alzheimer, or Dementia that usually occurs after 60 years of age. Before 60 years, there doesn’t exist a lapse of memory. Subsequently, the only cause of forgetfulness, or blunder headedness, is the lack of attention while working or performing multiple tasks at once without any interest. Moreover, it is often observed that while offering prayer, we lose attention mentally because of brainstorming. Remember! The proportionality of the two terms; work and attention, is directly correlated. Consciousness and attention are the two tools we can use to improve our memory. Besides, meditation also helps you to fix the memory disorders and build concentration. Thus, it is important to practice memory building exercises that build our focus and help us master our lifestyle with a wide array of blessings, consciousness and memory.

        Vitamin intake are of great significance to ensure adequate nutrition. The human body produces vitamin D in response to exposure of sunlight. It is responsible for maintenance<span id="dots52">...</span>
        <span id="more52" style="display: none;">  of healthy bones and teeth. It is a prohormone that protects from numerous diseases such as diabetes type 1, cancer, flu, high blood pressure, weak pregnancy and immune disorders etc. Despite the presence of vitamin D in a variety of foods like soy milk, yogurt, cheese, egg yolk, beef liver, orange juice, soy cereals, fatty fish, salmon, and mushrooms, our body can be prone to its deficiency. Lack of vitamin D causes osteomalacia that leads to muscular weakness, frequent body pain, fatigue and depression. To combat its deficiency, it is indispensable to have exposure to sunlight. Likewise, vitamin D injections can also be an alternative choice for people working indoors.

    <a href="#"> PSYCHIATRY vs. CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY</a>
    <p>
        The two fields, psychiatry and clinical psychology, are correlated with respect to mental health professions. While studying psychiatry, we come to know about its diverse perspectives. Psychiatrists<span id="dots51">...</span>
        <span id="more51" style="display: none;">   are medically trained doctors or physicians, who are done with their five years of med-schooling, and four years of residency (FCPS) or diploma. In fact, they treat patients with their psycho-pharmacological medicines. Patients pursue their 12-24 invariable sessions under kind supervision of psychiatrists.
            Contrary to it, clinical psychology is a study of human behavior, mind sciences and modalities of psychotherapy via analysis. A clinical psychologist diagnoses patients and implies talk-therapy. He researches and applies strategies on humanistic models and promotes awareness to lighten up the lives of patients with bright options to heal their mental illness. The basic tools for a clinical psychologist are autonomy, empowerment, and internal strength. Hence, the two professions are different but equally important in ensuring mental health, which is unfortunately, still a stigma, in the 21st century.

What's more, symptoms vary depending on how crucial the case is. Accordingly, in order to treat ulcers, avoid intake of drugs and acidic foods. Subsequently, in a condition of ulcer saying no to spices, tobacco and acidic meals will relieve you. A dangerous level of severity of the disease can form a hole in the lining of the stomach, that can spill the food out from the digestive tract. Endoscopy is often suggested by doctors to cope up the severity. Antibiotics can also help you recover, however, it is important to maintain a healthy lifestyle and adequate nutrition.

        Sun is the main source of blue light. However, digital devices like mobiles, tablets, LEDs and other gadgets also emit blue light. Thus, it is everywhere. There are different advantages linked with the blue light, though,<span id="dots49">...</span>
        <span id="more49" style="display: none;">   the disadvantages are severe than the pros. Notably, this type of light is associated with different physical and mental diseases. Since, eyes do not block the blue light, so it can cause cataracts, snow blindness, even cancer, permanent vision loss, eye strains and sleep discomfort. Additionally, it is bad to use digital gadgets at night, as they can be a culprit to your health, leading to diabetes, obesity and many other diseases. Yet, you can use blue light filters, or yellow tinted computer glasses to avoid affecting your health, while using digital devices for a long time. Moreover, take frequent breaks while using digital devices. Work with low brightness of screens at night to ensure a good night’s sleep.

    <p>
        Acupuncture is a Chinese alternative medicine. It helps in physical and mental conditions, and activates natural-healing processes within the body. It is a technique through which needles are injected in the<span id="dots47">...</span>
        <span id="more47" style="display: none;">   skin. When the various pressure points on the skin are kept pressed, they induce relief to different parts of the body. Basically, the region you press is a pressure point of any organ or gland of the trunk. For instance, the thumbs of your feet are related to the pineal and pituitary glands. Similarly, each and every part of your hands and feet are associated with any organ or a part. Acupuncture gives relief from pain, inhibits stress-mechanisms and releases toxins. Therefore, it is necessary to drink a glass of water after practicing acupuncture. It will help in flushing out various toxins. Any dehydration-causing agent is its worst culprit. Correspondingly, one can perform it once in a day or so, depending upon the severity of the disease.

An IBS patient suffers from food poisoning, constipation, gastric issues, nausea, vomiting, cramps and diarrhea. Additionally, food, stress or illness can also be factors of IBS. On the flip side, people who suffer from Inflammatory Bowel Disease face symptoms like ulcers and bleeding in the rectal portion, blocked bowels, bloody stools, extreme weight loss and anemia. There is no exact cure for such diseases, but they can be controlled with antibiotics, change in life-style or sometimes surgery (in IBD). However, pain can be felt in the whole abdominal region. A doctor can diagnose the kind of disorder due to specific localization of pain. For instance, pain in the lower-left region identifies IBS. While, left-sided pains are a definitive cause of ulcerative colitis (IBD).

    <a href="#"> Rights of servants</a>

        The Holy Prophet SAW said “You shouldn’t overburden them (servants) with what they cannot bear, and if you do so, help them (in their hard job).” <span id="dots45">...</span>
        <span id="more45" style="display: none;">   Above are the words often neglected nowadays. Today, many people don’t pay heed to the obligations inflicted upon them. To keep up with societal harmony, you need to make sure that you fulfill the rights of people around you. Do not overstrain your servants with the tasks if their health does not allow them to perform. Do not give them expired meals or damaged things to use. Treat them with kind words. Educate them about right and wrong. Because, a person doing your things, bound to your orders, is not your property but your obligation to take care of. If such ethics are not acted upon, it would make this world deprived of kindness and mercy. It is important to note that humanity is the essence of life. Thus, we should never violate someone’s rights.

        <span id="more44" style="display: none;">   new forms of trash composing face masks and disposables started accumulating after their disposal in the seas and oceans. Since then, the harms to marine life are increasing to the vast level. Many seagulls and fishes suffer from injuries when they unknowingly try to take that waste as food. It gets trapped around their legs, wings, and in throats of marine animals, ultimately leading to their death. Therefore, while throwing your face masks away in the bins, make sure to cut off their plastic straps (worn around ears). Additionally, wearing single-use plastic masks are not your savior against viruses. Switch to fabric/cloth masks which are ten times better for your health and safety measures.

        <span id="more38" style="display: none;">   mirror and evaluate your diet. If the pale color is localized or constant over your skin, it can indicate the insufficient blood circulation in your body. Iron, B12 and folate supplement would help you to cope up with it. Remember, puffy eyes are signs for Iodine thirst in your body. You can feel chronic symptoms like fatigue, dry skin and weight gain. The primary sources for Iodine are iodized salt, seafood and dairy products. Similarly, colorless lips are indicators of an Iron-deprived body. Low arterial blood pressure and frequent colds are the signs of Iron deficiency. You can fix it up by adding red meat, chicken, eggs, nuts and liver in your diets. Above and beyond, if you suffer from problems like bleeding gums, immunity and muscle pain then always remember that your body is crying for Vitamin C. Therefore, you need to regulate intake of citrus fruits. Likewise, your dry hair covered with dandruff is due to lack of Biotin in diet. What you all need is to doctorate yourself with meat, pulses, fruits, vegetables and mushrooms. To conclude, you cannot take minor nutrients for granted as they are crucially important to maintain your health.

        Alcoholism is a drinking issue, characterized by an uncontrollable desire to binge drink alcohol. Like other addictions, it has roots in early life relational problems and traumas. People are <span id="dots37">...</span>
        <span id="more37" style="display: none;">  likely to become alcoholics if they cannot resist from strain, low self-esteem, depression or any other psychological problem. However, family history is another cause for alcoholism amongst people who have a parent or close relative who is an alcoholic or has been alcoholic for some reason. Alcoholics practice alcoholism as a primary obligation. An abundance of alcohol leads to hepatitis, cirrhosis, jaundice, high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke and cancer. While paying heed to its cure, alcoholics should be helped with following a withdrawal schedule with a number of days and times to drink. They should try to omit at least two days to abandon alcoholism. Such people are advised not to keep alcohol at home as it will limit them to its reach. Another key point is to keep oneself busy and be persistent in withdrawal of this urge. A good long term consistent therapy from a clinical psychologist would also work better as it would certainly heal emotional wounds.

    <a href="#"> The harmful effects of carbonated beverages</a>
    <p>
        Americans take about 13 billion gallons of fizzy drinks per year. Fizzy drinks can be taken temporarily as an alternative to water, but sodas typically contain carbon dioxide, sugar, phosphoric<span id="dots35">...</span>
        <span id="more35" style="display: none;">  and citric acid, sodium, and excess calories. These components harm the body by causing problems like dehydration (dry skin and acne), calcium depletion, weight gain, high blood sugar, dementia, strokes and depression that can further lead to health complications i.e., liver damage and aging. Beverages purely contain large amounts of sugars that are turned into fats in the body, leading to belly fat accumulation. Moreover, sodas contain no nutrients. Hence, they just contribute to unnecessary calories, and resist your body from regulating the number of calories you eat and burn. Excess sugars is the principal cause of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Sugary drinks also cause heart diseases and cancer. Likewise, postmenopausal women who are more likely to drink carbonated beverages can be prey to endometrial cancer. Besides, fizzy drinks are a disaster to your dental health and bones (gout; due to accumulation of uric acid crystals). To conclude, it is important to abandon these drinks as soon as possible as they are injurious to our health. Let’s give your body a chance to heal and detoxify. Eat healthy!

        Smoking is a serious concern prevailing in the world. The physical cravings of smoking include tension, anxiety and throat or belly tightness etc. that induce the desire to smoke. But smoking actually <span id="dots34">...</span>
        <span id="more34" style="display: none;">  causes 90% of the deaths than caused by any other source like HIV, motorcycle injuries and use of illegal drugs. 80% of the deaths are due to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (caused by smoking) and 2 to 4 times deaths occur due to coronary heart disease and stroke. Whereas, the other harms include the low fertility rate, blood and cervical cancer, miscarriage and birth defects due to affected sperms in man. On the flip side, women-smokers usually face the problems like stillbirth, preterm, low birth weight, and orofacial clefts in infants. Moreover, bones are severely weakened due to smoking. Additional signs include infected gums, cataracts, type 2 diabetes mellitus, early menopause, rheumatoid arthritis, pneumonia, skin problems, ulcers, inflammation, high cholesterol, loss of appetite, bad breath, and loss of immunity. There also develops the risk of death, most smokers fail to reach their 65 years of age. To sum it up, lungs have magical ability to cure, but only if you stop smoking. Hence, it is important to either reduce smoking or entirely eliminate it. Nicotine takes 72 hours to get out of your body, thus, a person can escape from his cravings for nicotine in 12 days. Occasional smokers are exposed to less harm. While, a heavy smoker who quits smoking later halves his risk of death and rejuvenates his body organs back to normal within 5-10 years.

Apples stimulate alkaline saliva that helps in cleaning of teeth. In addition, they also reduce visceral belly fat. Furthermore, dietary addition of apples may contribute to inducing a glow on your skin. It has been a universal fact that one should consume more than 1 fruit servings on the table. The perfect time for fruits is in the morning after taking a glass of water. Whenever taken, try not to peel off apples as the roughage in it is the cleaner of your intestine. Remember that apple itself is the best choice. Make sure to consume it in its original form rather than a juice that halves the nutrients than before.

        <span id="more31" style="display: none;"> a group of symptoms that result in poor memory and cognitive functions. The other possible signs of dementia include short-term memory changes, confusion, feelings of apathy, changes in mood, difficulty in finding words, failing sense of direction and being repetitive. In addition to it, sleeping a lot is also a symptom in later stages. As a matter of fact, taste buds are diminished with age so people with dementia may like to have heavy or sweet treats. Highly processed food, refined carbs, sugary drinks, aspartame, alcohol and fish high in mercury are highly causative agents for this disease. Whereas, leafy green veggies, berries, nuts, omega 3, spices and seeds are helpful in fighting against it. Cheese can also lead to impaired memory. Lastly, people with dementia need to be physically active and avoid things like smoking, unhealthy foods, alcohol and smoking in order to get rid of the disease.

    <a href="#"> EARLY BIRD OR NIGHT OWL?</a>
    <p>
        It is hard to keep pace with time as the immense work pressure of the current age keeps people occupied. Every “Lark” (person who is efficient in morning) and night owl has his own sleep schedule. <span id="dots26">...</span>
        <span id="more26" style="display: none;"> But due to the stroke of ill-luck, night owls have more chances to adopt serious health complications like diabetes, neurological, gastrointestinal and respiratory disorders. Moving onwards to whatsoever category you belong, always remember to enjoy your magical morning. Motivate yourself to accomplish those peak day tasks which you likely plan to do. It could simply be anything starting from reading a book or enjoying cup of tea. Another tip is to expose yourself to morning light as much as you can, since it plays biologically effective role via head-lighting your brain to start the day. Whatever is your current time for hitting the hay and getting up, don’t be harsh on it. What you need is just to advance 15 minutes early to your bedtime. Similarly, wake up 15 minutes before your normal time. Reducing this gradually is the best way to meet your ideal timings. An ideal sleep cycle maintenance is necessary as the recent research has indicated the risks of heart diseases occurring due to improper sleep-wake schedule. Therefore, form a schedule that fits your every day of the week. Variability of one hour is absorbable on Sundays. However, you can also have a dose of 30 minutes as your siesta time but don’t exceed the time. At nights, try avoiding the contact with electronic screens as they have blue light technology in them which disturbs melatonin. Remember, consistency is the key. Have you breakfast as the king and dinner as a slave.

        No man can survive in an isolation. Man has always been social animal. Life of an individual is all about his social and <span id="dots24">...</span>
        <span id="more24" style="display: none;"> personal values, his failures and distinctions, evils and humanities. As a matter of fact, each and every aspect of life correlated with society is coincident to your surroundings. It is the man who has to bond with society to keep a company that feeds the soul. Similarly, you are recognized by your company. A company, which determines your character, habits, lifestyle, and your personal achievements. It is as important factor as the brain of nervous system. Therefore, one should be wise enough to differentiate between right and wrong, truth and false, and sycophant and supercilious companies. Times change so do people, thus be witty while searching for your confidant. Someone can be inspiring by looks but a black hole by heart. At times, your social circle gives you fake pleasure but later you will thank your self-control. Because your company is the only soul of your body that can either please you with mental fitness or mental illness.  </i> </span>

    <p>
        Life is primarily driven by your belief system. The positive thoughts bring positive experiences to one’s life, and <span id="dots23">...</span>
        <span id="more23" style="display: none;"> vice versa. The further subdivisions of law of attraction are the law of manifestation, magnetism, unwavering desire, delicate balance, harmony, right action and law of universal influence. It states that you will be attracted to the thing you chase, focus on and spend your energy with. The first and foremost thing you need to work with, is time. The more you spend, the wilder will be the results. With respect to psychology, it is called “Internal vs. External Locus of Control.” In other words, it is synonymous with, “you are what you think.” You will only attract to the positivity and productivity if you will focus on it. To construe it up, all you have to do is align your mind, thoughts and feelings for that specific thing. Have faith that you are going to achieve that so soon. Your high or low frequency is the foundation of your results which is a magnetic phenomenon because it is the only mind-body relation that works constantly.  </i> </span>

    <a href="#">Creative Writing</a>
    <p>
        Creative writing is an open art, never four-walled to academics or journalism. It is a <span id="dots22">...</span>
        <span id="more22" style="display: none;"> kind of polished talent that can take you to the heights of glory with due efforts. Creative writers usually begin from short story writing or simple poems to biographies and so on. But they end on their vivid destiny like screen or play writers. At first, content writers may face the mini-problems like vague topics of discussions and the chaotic challenges to begin the creative writing journey. To cope up with this, you can separate a jar, where you can put your chits in it. On those chits, you can write common names of topics like determination, passion, creativity, stress and tension, exercise and whatever topic that interests you. Whenever, you want to write, just pick up any one of those chits and start writing on that particular subject. Remember, your initial lines should be the introduction, middle ones about explanation and conclusion should always be at the end. Students can earn the fame and expertise at very young age, if they are proficient in English. They can also initiate by participating in co-curricular activities like publishing articles in magazines and newspapers. With enough time, you will be pro in writing. Lastly, it is important to have enough reading exposure to build a fine vocabulary to incorporate in your piece of writing.  </i> </span>

    <a href="#">How to Tackle Food Allergies</a>
    <p>
        Food allergy is the hypersensitive immune response of the body due to certain food allergens. The most commonly associated allergy causing foods are fish, <span id="dots21">...</span>
        <span id="more21" style="display: none;"> shellfish, milk, wheat, tree nuts, peanuts, egg and soy. Nowadays, the rate of food allergy has been inclined to level up. As an allergy can be life threatening, visit your nutritionist if you face food discomfort. Food allergy refers to an immune system reaction affecting different body organs. On the flip side, food intolerance has less serious signs and does not involve the immune system. Therefore, it is your task to identify and track the food you take to pinpoint the problem. Once you pinpoint the upsetting food, you should immediately stop consuming that. Play the detective role of yours; make a diet plan or food diary when symptoms occur, and identify the causative food and its allergy symptoms. Moreover, limit those foods which do not upset your gut. You can try food options as well, and acknowledge whether they are right for your stomach or not. You can also help yourself in exploring the diet you take regularly, if signs and symptoms are continual. However, it is necessary to consult your dietician for your diet in order to enjoy a healthy life.   </i> </span>

    <a href="#">How to improve your English language</a>
    <p>
        The impact of the most widely spoken and world-wide recognized language, English, cannot be denied in our lives. As we advance,  <span id="dots19">...</span>
        <span id="more19" style="display: none;"> we step into the corporate world of literature, science and technology, which is dominated by the west. Therefore, it is important to learn the basics of learning English. The most common problem encountered by us is that we know English, but we cannot understand native speakers sometimes, or we are unable to interact with them in a fluent way. Thus, we should work on improving our proficiency in English, the core of western world. If you are passionate, do not just try to read a lot. Because, you may not know the right pronunciation. In this case, listening to English will help you in unexpected ways, as you will learn the correct pronunciation of the words along with heaps of vocabulary that will enhance your fluency. Moreover, translating word to word in your mother language is also smart strategy to learn. Whereas, in regular verbose, it can erode away your interest from reading. You can also use 80/20 rule; 80% of speaking and listening whereas 20% of reading and writing. However, the ratio can vary to 20/80% in case if you are doing any academic research. The next thing is to make it simpler and easier. Do not involve too much in both; having fluency and an accurate grammar. Do not just overcomplicate. Just start speaking it with people, perhaps your friends and siblings. Watch Hollywood TV series and movies, listen to audio videos. And practice it at least 15 minutes every single day. And slow and steady, you will be a pro in English language. </i> </span>

        <span id="more16" style="display: none;">  The specific quality of this kind of craving is that it cannot help someone   resisting from enjoying the meals.

But, on the flip side, man regrets about being flooded with food later. The emotional symptoms included are; relieving the tension by taking food, embarrassment over the quantity being taken and desperation to control weight and eating habits. However, you can remove this temptation with healthy eating. Instead of eating mindlessly,  be a mindful eater. Learn to tolerate and develop healthier lifestyle. Be punctual in exercising, sleeping and social routines. Furthermore, in case if you encounter your loved one facing the similar situation, try to be supportive rather than being judgmental.

    <a href="#">FORTY RULES OF LOVE</a>
    <p>
         First few golden rules from, “Forty Rules of Love.” <span id="dots14"> ...</span>
        <span id="more14" style="display: none;"> <br>Rule no. 1: “How we see God is a direct reflection of how we see ourselves. If God brings to mind mostly fear and blame, it means there is too much fear and blame welled inside us. If we see God as full of love and compassion, so are we.


            <br>Rule no. 2: “The path to the Truth is a labor of the heart, not of the head. Make your heart your primary guide! Not your mind. Meet, challenge, and ultimately prevail over your nafs with your heart.  Knowing your self will lead you to the knowledge of God.”
            
            
            <br>Rule no. 3: “Each and every reader comprehends the Holy Quran on a different level in tandem with the depth of his understanding. There are four levels of insight. The first level is the outer meaning and it is the one that the majority of the people are content with. Next is the Batini_the inner level. Third, there is the inner of the inner. And the fourth level is so deep it cannot be put into words and is therefore bound to remain indescribable.”
            
            
            <br>Rule no. 4: “You can study God through everything and everyone in the universe, because God is not confined in a mosque, synagogue, or church. But if you are still in need of knowing where exactly His abode is, there is only one place to look for Him: in the heart of a true lover.”
            
            
            <br>Rule no. 5: “Intellect and love are made of different materials. Intellect ties people in knots and risks nothing, but love dissolves all tangles and risks everything. Intellect is always cautious and advises, ‘Beware too much ecstasy,’ whereas love says, ‘Oh, never mind! Take the plunge! Intellect does not easily break down, whereas love can effortlessly reduce itself to rubble. But treasures are hidden among ruins. A broken heart his treasures.”

         Majority of people are facing the issue to supervise their health due to reasons that vary in tones. Either, they face the time shortage or their fragile imbalanced <span id="dots13"> ...</span>
        <span id="more13" style="display: none;"> diet doesn’t help them to take care of their health. In order to cope up with such circumstances and to have a good health. Here are some of the top suggestions enlisted. No matter how busy you are, science has helped mankind in thousands of ways that are still taken for granted. To construe it up, there exists a rule of prioritizing your work. Firstly, accomplish your top three things mentioned in your to-do list. Secondly, take care about the outings you do. Make sure if enjoying a coffee with your friend is damn important rather working out. Still, if you can’t visit nearest gymnasium then ensure yourself to work-out at home. What it all takes is minimum ten minutes. Devoting four-four minutes to kettlebell exercises and abs work, and two minutes to squats and lunges are all what your body primarily needs. However, you can categorize these according to your most prioritized exercises that can heal you from stress. Activities like early morning walk, gardening, and swimming is the best criterion for your health. As far as healthy eating is concerned, be sure to cook in bulk so that they can be consumed 2-3 days if you are occupied. Tomatoes (good for your heart), spinach (good for your brain), blueberries (good for your cholesterol), salmon (good for weight loss) and pumpkin seeds (good for your memory) are all the required meals for your body fuels. Staying hydrated is yet, another plus point! </span>

    <a href="#">WAYS FOR FOCUSED STUDY</a>
    <p>
        Work is an exercise for body parts, either physically or mentally. The mental exercises help with the focused work rather than the diffused one. <span id="dots12">...</span>
        <span id="more12" style="display: none;"> The tip number one to gain concentration for studying is to find pleasure in what you do, regardless of how hard that task is. You can also bring five times more attention to your challenge if you always find yourself at the same place (example, study table), and at the same time (i.e., 10 am everyday) for your study. Your to-do list should always be under your supervision. Cutting your accomplished task can help you in self-motivation. Prioritizing your tasks into categories (urgent : important, urgent : unimportant, not urgent : important and not urgent : unimportant) is also a good source for signifying what is better for you to complete first. Setting up a schedule for your duration of study should always be in your mind, e.g., 1 hour of study with a 5 minute break. This will help you focusing to the level-up. Moreover, staying hydrated and taking glucose-rich diet at breaks can strengthen your attention. Make sure if you are studying offline, then your distraction causing devices are far aside or turned off. Lastly, motivating background music can also help to concentrate better.</span>

             fourth industrial revolution. A.I. means teaching the machine and making the machine becoming smart. An Artificial Intelligent Machine learns by itself and not by explicit programming. Today, machine learning is combating one of the leading causes of blindness, and enabling people with a neurological disease like A-L-S (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) to communicate with their surroundings. A.I. is changing the way we think about the mind and body. 
            <br>Besides, advancement in A.I has made it possible for a machine to compete like an athlete, write a movie, and bring autonomous self-driving cars into existence through reinforcement learning. Currently, NASA is using A.I to build habitat autonomously on Mars using reinforcement learning for the space explorers before they arrive at Mars.
            Today Network Science Institute at Northeastern University in Boston claims that they can model the whole physical world using the available data and computing power.
            
            <br>Suppose you want to dive into A.I. and wish to learn about how to integrate A.I. applications in your daily routine tasks or your business. In that case, there is a free course offered through Coursera Inc by Professor Andrew Ng. To see course details,

    <p>
        Nail is an alpha-keratinous plate found on the tip of fingers and toes. <span id="dots9">...</span>
        <span id="more9" style="display: none;"> This horn-like structure called nail, if defected, can indicate signs of sickness in an individual. Through a nail, its shape, color and surface, a lot of knowledge about underlying health conditions can be discovered. Starting from the extreme positive end; healthy nails are always strong, flat and white or ivory-colored, and never flaky. However, thin pale nails result due to iron deficiency in the body. To construe it up, yellowish color in nails is a result of renal and gastrointestinal tract problems. Moreover, knobbly nails represent an infection in the body. Additionally, lack of zinc, copper and iodine can lead to white dots and streaks on the nails. Crumbling yellow or black nails occur due to fungal infection. Furthermore, brittle nails result from lack of iron and beta-carotene. Pitted nails can be a cause of skin disorder, psoriasis, eczema, or arthritis. Koilonychia is a spooning of nail resulting in raised ridges that can be due to lack of iron and so on.</span>

Moreover, it signifies higher rep ranges for individual exercises, generally in 8-12 or 12-15 range are often performed in ‘superset’, where one exercise is immediately followed by another without a rest period. Cardio and diet also play a huge part in a bodybuilding program, as fat-loss and maintaining a lean physique are incredibly important.

    <p>
        Refined Oils: Refined vegetable oils are processed edibles manufactured from chemical processing which makes for their nature acidic and bleached transparent color. These oils can be unhealthy for our bodies.<span id="dots5">...</span>
        <span id="more5" style="display: none;"> Therefore, try using extra virgin olive oil and
            coconut oil, or ghee. Although saturated fats can contribute to heart diseases if
            the cholesterol level of the body is not regulated. But they are relatively
            healthier, with
            no side effects. White Sugar: White sugar is also known as ‘white poison’. Sugar, in
            its unprocessed form is present in sugarcane and beet root. It contains phosphorous,
            sulfur, zinc, vitamins, natural enzymes, and
            other trace elements. The added chemicals and the bleaching agents during its
            processing result in its crystal white color, while causing mineral losses. To
            construe it up, excess sugar intake can cause obesity and
            even diabetes. As an alternate to white sugar, use ‘Gurr’ or ‘Shakkar’. All-purpose
            White Flour: All-purpose white flour (aka maida) consists of smallest particle size
            and hence, minimal fibre. Consequently, it is more
            prone to intensify IBS and may stick to the intestinal walls, thus affecting the
            whole digestion process. You can use whole grain flour or chakki-aatta to substitute
            for a healthier living.</span>

    <a href="#">Taking care of mental health</a>
    <p>
        Just like our physical health, mental fitness plays quite a significant part in our well-being. World could turn into a cringy place if it is not fed enough care.<span id="dots4">...</span><span id="more4" style="display: none;"> What is considered more
            of a taboo can unfortunately, at times, plunge us into madness,
            depression or can even lead to agony of suicide. However, there are certain measures
            that can treat your panic or depressive episodes including exercise, meditation,
            staying hydrated, getting enough sunshine, getting fresh
            air, taking a cold shower, getting at least 6 to 8 hours of sleep, and lastly,
            engaging your mind to maximize your productivity. Similarly, the edibles for it may
            include anything that inclines the dopamine level (any-thing
            tasty and toothsome). Because the sweetness at the end becomes the only reliable
            source for take-it-easy-way. After all, you have to love yourself to be a warrior of
            light and kindness to this world. Thus, mental and emotional
            peace is immensely important for a person to find the passion and fulfill the
            meaning of his life, and make this world a better place.

        Women never enjoyed the prestige and footing as they stand by it now. Even in patriarchal societies, women have been out-performing their due-roles in every walk of life with their <span id="dots3">...</span>
        <span id="more3" style="display: none;">twofold productive capacity as compared to men.
            They deserve to be treated with utmost esteem to equip them with social, financial
            and matrimonial independence. Their involvement in every field of life outshines
            their social
            capabilities. Women preserve human race and are entitled to freedom of sentiments to
            put forward their opinions on public, legislative and religious matters. Therefore,
            they must be designated to pursue their passions.
            Without their involvement, the pace of scientific and technological development of
            one’s nation would be extremely compromised. The global history is full of the names
            of the rising stars who were eminent pundits, poets,
            teachers, suffis and businesswomen exiling in their respective fields. Women have
            been illuminating their potentials since forever in the form of Hellen Keller,
            Benazir Bhutto or Margaret Thatcher. Currently, these
            beacons of hope are Hilary Clinton, Angelina Jolie, Malala Yousafzai, Oprah Winfrey,
            Jane Goodall, Beyonce, Jacinda Ardern and so on. Even in digital space, they have
            earned a significant place by becoming influencers,
            fashion-stylists, makeup artists, digital creators and bloggers. In retrospect, the

        Our everlasting lust for skin whiteness has originated from prehistoric colonial times. As a result, many individuals in our societies,<span id="dots2">...</span>
        <span id="more2" style="display: none;"> especially females, are fed with a burden of
            attaining white skin tone at the risk of identity crisis. To address our
            complex for darker skin, we have been advertising makeup products or cosmetics with
            an intention to lighten our original skin color. Is to remember that the brownness
            of our skin is a blessing in disguise as our melanin
            production is anatural process of shielding our skin. Each of us has been blessed
            with the best of our features. And as far as the makeup is concerned, it should only
            be done to enhance your features or modify our looks
            with elegance. To whiten the skin tone is a fallacy. Excess of anything is
            unnecessary and futile. Still, many of our beauty clinics and salons, including the
            skin-whitening industry, have overlooked this aspect. They prey
            on the insecurities of their customers, loot them and rob them of their identities.
            Therefore, it is important to teach our children that they are beautiful no matter
            what their skin color is. We have to create awareness
            on the concept of “being you.” So why should not we praise Almighty for what we are
            born with, rather than pretending to be what we are not!.</span>

            One of the best vision-friendly sources is accurate diet and nutrition. You need to have precise information of fruits and vegetables that will assist you in granting good and bright eyesight.
            Initially, you need to add veggies rich in Beta-Carotene like carrot juice, baked sweet potato and pumpkin soup. Another organic source is green vegetables rich in xanthophylls; Lutein and Zeaxanthin that are present in spinach, broccoli, peas, kale and lettuce. Omega-3 is an alternative source which also helps with dry eyes. The supplements of Omega-3 are fish, salmon, walnut and tuna. Besides, vitamin E and Omega-3s that are present in chia, flax, sunflower and hemp seeds are surely great for your range of vision. Juices are an additional effective and liable source of fitness for your vision and these may include grapefruit, lemon and orange juices. You also need to bless your eyes with beef, eggs, whole grains, almonds and water. Last but not the least is Gamma-Linolenic acid to cure dry-eyes problems.

    <a href="#"> Factors affecting aging</a>
    <p>
        Aging is the most anxiety-causing factor in adults of the present day. There are many factors affecting aging that briefly include water, food, sleep, functionality, mental state and unnecessary fears. Following<span id="dots67">...</span>
        <span id="more67" style="display: none;">    are the succinct descriptions of the factors:<br>
            1. Water is an essential element of life. It eradicates all the signs of dryness. Therefore, intake of water is inversely proportional to aging. The more the water is taken, the less it is susceptible to aging.<br>
            2. Food is fuel. To combat aging, one needs to regulate intake of three respective colors; green, yellow and white. Green color is an evidence of chlorophyll which is found in various fruits and vegetables. Yellow color presents food rich in enzymes and vitamin B complex, whereas white color resonates with an alkaline and fibre-rich diet.<br>
            3. Fitness is a part of relaxation and sleep. It is better not to sleep too much or too less, but it must be for 7-8 hours in accordance with nature's biological clock. Hence, lawbreaking (being a night owl or snoozing in day) is prohibited.<br>
            4. Make sure to exercise and to perform stretches so that activity of muscles does not fade away.<br>
            5. Mental state is always given a priority to maintain its fitness and proactivity. One needs to make sure about his healthy and peaceful mindset. Because, the one with depression and anxiety will be the worst culprit.<br>
            6. Lastly, but most importantly is the factor of not keeping unnatural fear of aging. It has been researched that the people who continuously fear about aging are usually the prey to it.<br>
            
            Enlisted above are the features of aging and we are in dire need of tips permitting us to enjoy teen-age once again. Therefore, we need to legalize healthy lifestyles, and to have benefits from natural sources.

    <a href="#"> Exertion shouts out loud</a>
    <p>
        Physical exertion means an effort to pull, push or lift a body part or any object in order to strengthen muscles. As activity of muscles fades away if, somehow, <span id="dots60">...</span>
        <span id="more60" style="display: none;">   they are no longer brought in workouts. Thus, physical exertion is of great importance since it helps against aging, and preserves bone density. Exertion also creates antibodies against several chronic diseases and improves sleep schedules. Equally, the essence of functionality is directly proportional to fitness, therefore, patients of depression are always advised for the functional exercises so that their bodies could perform at a metabolically active rate. Moreover, exertion has an endless list of health benefits. It ensures the quality of life for diversity of people pursuing little to no effort, or hard climbing exercises. Briefly, for the people who are not fascinated by exercises can spare some time for no effort-exercises like controlled breathing through the nose, talking freely and comfortably, taking breaks while talking and so on.

    <a href="#"> Grammar: The gateway to English</a>
    <p>
        English grammar is another core-part of the language besides literature. Normally, it is observed that we pay heed to the speaking skills like fluency, vast diction <span id="dots59">...</span>
        <span id="more59" style="display: none;">   and verbose etc. Whereas, the grammar is usually not stressed upon enough. While writing and speaking, grammar always remains under observation of the checker or listener.  It has a vast syllabi composed of parts of speech, tenses, punctuation, idioms, pair of words and much more which majority of us knows and wants to learn further. But the point of fact is that all of this knowledge is now a part of our subconscious brain. Thus, it is true to say that knowing is never enough, but practicing is. Accordingly, in order to practice English grammar you can purchase a grammar book and spare a minimum half hour to work on grammar on a daily basis. Additionally, in the era of today, you can seek training on YouTube or from various online platforms under kind supervision of coaches. Additionally, it is important to note that never fear making mistakes. Being a beginner you have certainly the right to make mistakes and rectify them. As practice makes the man perfect, so it is important to stay consistent to your learning schedules!

    <a href="#"> The LAST LECTURE by Randy Pausch</a>
    <p>
        ‘The last lecture’ is a must-read autobiography inscribed by Randy Pausch, an American educator and a professor of computer science <span id="dots58">...</span>
        <span id="more58" style="display: none;">   at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, and Jeffrey Zaslow, a well-known coauthor of top ranked books. In this book, Pausch, an optimist dreamer, narrates a bright side of his story even after being diagnosed with ten tumors in his liver. Randy throws light on the last lecture which he delivered before his demise, which was all about his beliefs about high aims. He emphasized never to have obsessions on what people think. The same, he discussed childhood dreams, overcoming hindrances, and knowing about the intellectual-emotional fact that ‘Time is all you have. And you may find one day that you have less than you think.’ To sum it up, this memoir is enlightened with humor, aptitude and motivation.

                <h2>About us</h2>
                <p> Welcome to Wordophic! It is the brainchild of Adnan Khan and Eman Ahmad Shaikh which highlights different flavors of life. As far as its journey is concerned, Wordophic commenced when we identified the lack of space for writers and prosers
                    in publishing industry. "I once tried to publish a magazine but didn 't know the publication process." -Eman Ahmad Shaikh. This idea popped up the next significant step of Wordophic in mind. It took some days in research to grow Pakistan's
                    online ecosystem. Wordophic has dogged belief that the right to be published should not be fourwalled or limited upto certain writing topics but to be secular in writings. So the contents are written by our in-house team which showcases
                    its work and beget healthy discussions. Wordophic also helps students master public writing signature, building self-esteem and learn about literature and narration. . </p>
