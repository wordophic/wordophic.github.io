    <a href="#">BINGE EATING DISORDER</a>
    <p>
        Binge eating is the form of eating that quenches the cravings by inappropriately taking big quantities of food.  <span id="dots16">...</span>
        <span id="more16" style="display: none;">  The specific quality of this kind of craving is that it cannot help someone   resisting from enjoying the meals. And at the near-end, there comes a point when one becomes guilty about himself on eating too much and at lack of self-control. However, that is comforting at the moment. But, on the flip side, man regrets about being flooded with food later. The emotional symptoms included are; relieving the tension by taking food, embarrassment over the quantity being taken and desperation to control weight and eating habits. However, you can remove this temptation with healthy eating. Instead of eating mindlessly,  be a mindful eater. Learn to tolerate and develop healthier lifestyle. Be punctual in exercising, sleeping and social routines. Furthermore, in case if you encounter your loved one facing the similar situation, try to be supportive rather than being judgmental. And, set up a good example for them!</i> </span>

    <a href="#">FORTY RULES OF LOVE</a>
    <p>
        First few golden rules from, “Forty Rules of Love.”  <span id="dots14">...</span>
        <span id="more14" style="display: none;"> <br>Rule no. 1: “How we see God is a direct reflection of how we see ourselves. If God brings to mind mostly fear and blame, it means there is too much fear and blame welled inside us. If we see God as full of love and compassion, so are we.


            <br>Rule no. 2: “The path to the Truth is a labor of the heart, not of the head. Make your heart your primary guide! Not your mind. Meet, challenge, and ultimately prevail over your nafs with your heart.  Knowing your self will lead you to the knowledge of God.”
            
            
            <br>Rule no. 3: “Each and every reader comprehends the Holy Quran on a different level in tandem with the depth of his understanding. There are four levels of insight. The first level is the outer meaning and it is the one that the majority of the people are content with. Next is the Batini_the inner level. Third, there is the inner of the inner. And the fourth level is so deep it cannot be put into words and is therefore bound to remain indescribable.”
            
            
            <br>Rule no. 4: “You can study God through everything and everyone in the universe, because God is not confined in a mosque, synagogue, or church. But if you are still in need of knowing where exactly His abode is, there is only one place to look for Him: in the heart of a true lover.”
            
            
            <br>Rule no. 5: “Intellect and love are made of different materials. Intellect ties people in knots and risks nothing, but love dissolves all tangles and risks everything. Intellect is always cautious and advises, ‘Beware too much ecstasy,’ whereas love says, ‘Oh, never mind! Take the plunge! Intellect does not easily break down, whereas love can effortlessly reduce itself to rubble. But treasures are hidden among ruins. A broken heart his treasures.”

    <a href="#">How Busy People Manage their Health?</a>
    <p>
        Majority of people are facing the issue to supervise their health due to reasons that vary in tones. Either, they face the time shortage or their fragile imbalanced  <span id="dots13">...</span>
        <span id="more13" style="display: none;"> diet doesn’t help them to take care of their health. In order to cope up with such circumstances and to have a good health. Here are some of the top suggestions enlisted. No matter how busy you are, science has helped mankind in thousands of ways that are still taken for granted. To construe it up, there exists a rule of prioritizing your work. Firstly, accomplish your top three things mentioned in your to-do list. Secondly, take care about the outings you do. Make sure if enjoying a coffee with your friend is damn important rather working out. Still, if you can’t visit nearest gymnasium then ensure yourself to work-out at home. What it all takes is minimum ten minutes. Devoting four-four minutes to kettlebell exercises and abs work, and two minutes to squats and lunges are all what your body primarily needs. However, you can categorize these according to your most prioritized exercises that can heal you from stress. Activities like early morning walk, gardening, and swimming is the best criterion for your health. As far as healthy eating is concerned, be sure to cook in bulk so that they can be consumed 2-3 days if you are occupied. Tomatoes (good for your heart), spinach (good for your brain), blueberries (good for your cholesterol), salmon (good for weight loss) and pumpkin seeds (good for your memory) are all the required meals for your body fuels. Staying hydrated is yet, another plus point! </span>

                            <p>
                                Work is an exercise for body parts, either physically or mentally. The mental exercises help with the focused work rather than the diffused one. <span id="dots12">...</span>
                                <span id="more12" style="display: none;"> The tip number one to gain concentration for studying is to find pleasure in what you do, regardless of how hard that task is. You can also bring five times more attention to your challenge if you always find yourself at the same place (example, study table), and at the same time (i.e., 10 am everyday) for your study. Your to-do list should always be under your supervision. Cutting your accomplished task can help you in self-motivation. Prioritizing your tasks into categories (urgent : important, urgent : unimportant, not urgent : important and not urgent : unimportant) is also a good source for signifying what is better for you to complete first. Setting up a schedule for your duration of study should always be in your mind, e.g., 1 hour of study with a 5 minute break. This will help you focusing to the level-up. Moreover, staying hydrated and taking glucose-rich diet at breaks can strengthen your attention. Make sure if you are studying offline, then your distraction causing devices are far aside or turned off. Lastly, motivating background music can also help to concentrate better.</span>

        As quoted by Professor Andrew Ng, "Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) is the new electricity," This new electricity drives the world towards the  <span id="dots11">...</span>

             fourth industrial revolution. A.I. means teaching the machine and making the machine becoming smart. An Artificial Intelligent Machine learns by itself and not by explicit programming. Today, machine learning is combating one of the leading causes of blindness, and enabling people with a neurological disease like A-L-S (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) to communicate with their surroundings. A.I. is changing the way we think about the mind and body. 
            <br>Besides, advancement in A.I has made it possible for a machine to compete like an athlete, write a movie, and bring autonomous self-driving cars into existence through reinforcement learning. Currently, NASA is using A.I to build habitat autonomously on Mars using reinforcement learning for the space explorers before they arrive at Mars.
            Today Network Science Institute at Northeastern University in Boston claims that they can model the whole physical world using the available data and computing power.
            
            <br>Suppose you want to dive into A.I. and wish to learn about how to integrate A.I. applications in your daily routine tasks or your business. In that case, there is a free course offered through Coursera Inc by Professor Andrew Ng. To see course details,

                            <p>
                                The deeper you think, the more you grow, awaken and explore. The raw thoughts popping in your mind are initially the words without soul that may not make much sense,  <span id="dots10">...</span>
                                <span id="more10" style="display: none;">  but possess immense potential to be transformed into reality. Your thoughts mould into your actions. And with time and consistency, these actions can ultimately manifested as habits. The more actions you do, the more habits you develop, hence transforming your infrequent habits into frequent character. This character ultimately becomes your identity and helps you explore known and the unknown corners of your mystical glory i.e. your absolute destiny. And what is this destiny? It is life!
                                    Thus, the takeaway is that your journey begins with just a thought. It is your thoughts that manufacture your mentality and spirit of life, and subsequently define your journey in life. Think good to have a fortune that traces your eloquence and positivity in life. Remember that you have the power of potential. Your thoughts construct your destiny because and you become what you think.</span>

    <p>
        Nail is an alpha-keratinous plate found on the tip of fingers and toes. <span id="dots9">...</span>
        <span id="more9" style="display: none;"> This horn-like structure called nail, if defected, can indicate signs of sickness in an individual. Through a nail, its shape, color and surface, a lot of knowledge about underlying health conditions can be discovered. Starting from the extreme positive end; healthy nails are always strong, flat and white or ivory-colored, and never flaky. However, thin pale nails result due to iron deficiency in the body. To construe it up, yellowish color in nails is a result of renal and gastrointestinal tract problems. Moreover, knobbly nails represent an infection in the body. Additionally, lack of zinc, copper and iodine can lead to white dots and streaks on the nails. Crumbling yellow or black nails occur due to fungal infection. Furthermore, brittle nails result from lack of iron and beta-carotene. Pitted nails can be a cause of skin disorder, psoriasis, eczema, or arthritis. Koilonychia is a spooning of nail resulting in raised ridges that can be due to lack of iron and so on.</span>

Moreover, it signifies higher rep ranges for individual exercises, generally in 8-12 or 12-15 range are often performed in ‘superset’, where one exercise is immediately followed by another without a rest period. Cardio and diet also play a huge part in a bodybuilding program, as fat-loss and maintaining a lean physique are incredibly important.

                                Man is a product of information stored in his genes. Our genotype defines our core characteristics that we have no ability to alter. On the <span id="dots6">...</span>
                                <span id="more6" style="display: none;"> flip side, our apparent bodily traits that may
                                    be influenced by the nature and nurture is what we call phenotype.
                                    A great person is neither he, who defines himself by his materialistic wealth. Nor
                                    he, who compares himself with the others. But the one who has great sense of vision.
                                    Thus, greatness is not specific or limited to anyone
                                    but occupies a commonplace for all. Because all are blessed with potentials and
                                    instincts that could be best utilized via gratitude. If you have nothing to be
                                    grateful for, just feel the heartbeat. What is it? It is life.
                                    This life and the cardia that can sense it, it is your greatness, and this provoking
                                    feeling is absolutely mesmerizing! So let’s inquire about the steps towards
                                    greatness. Answer is, it begins when you transform yourself
                                    from animalhood to manhood.</span>

                                Refined Oils: Refined vegetable oils are processed edibles manufactured from chemical processing which makes for their nature acidic and bleached transparent color. These oils can be unhealthy for our bodies.<span id="dots5">...</span>
                                <span id="more5" style="display: none;"> Therefore, try using extra virgin olive oil and

                                    the cholesterol level of the body is not regulated. But they are relatively

                                    its unprocessed form is present in sugarcane and beet root. It contains phosphorous,

                                    other trace elements. The added chemicals and the bleaching agents during its
                                    processing result in its crystal white color, while causing mineral losses. To

                                    they must be designated to pursue their passions.

                                    one’s nation would be extremely compromised. The global history is full of the names

                                    Benazir Bhutto or Margaret Thatcher. Currently, these

                            <p>
                                Our everlasting lust for skin whiteness has originated from prehistoric colonial times. As a result, many individuals in our societies,<span id="dots2">...</span>
                                <span id="more2" style="display: none;"> especially females, are fed with a burden of
                                    attaining white skin tone at the risk of identity crisis. To address our
                                    complex for darker skin, we have been advertising makeup products or cosmetics with
                                    an intention to lighten our original skin color. Is to remember that the brownness
                                    of our skin is a blessing in disguise as our melanin
                                    production is anatural process of shielding our skin. Each of us has been blessed
                                    with the best of our features. And as far as the makeup is concerned, it should only
                                    be done to enhance your features or modify our looks
                                    with elegance. To whiten the skin tone is a fallacy. Excess of anything is
                                    unnecessary and futile. Still, many of our beauty clinics and salons, including the
                                    skin-whitening industry, have overlooked this aspect. They prey
                                    on the insecurities of their customers, loot them and rob them of their identities.
                                    Therefore, it is important to teach our children that they are beautiful no matter
                                    what their skin color is. We have to create awareness
                                    on the concept of “being you.” So why should not we praise Almighty for what we are
                                    born with, rather than pretending to be what we are not!.</span>

                            <p>
                                Everybody has the power of imagination. Your thoughts behold reality and your reality determines your destiny. As you dive deeper <span id="dots1">...</span>
                                <span id="more1" style="display: none;"> into the roots of law of attraction, you
                                    realize that your perception derives your genetic code, thereby controlling your
                                    life. No two witted people can see the world in the same way. Their perceptions can
                                    be accurate or inaccurate, authentic or unauthentic, thus it is more on target to
                                    say that belief controls biology. Your beliefs create
                                    your life. As it is said that: “You create everything that happens to you.” –Jack
                                    Canfield People who passionately long for their dreams are the ones who transform
                                    them into reality. If you choose to be happy, you amplify
                                    your happiness and vibrate at such a frequency that generates influence on the
                                    people around you with your happy aura. On the flip side, obsessing on the negative
                                    energies ultimately constructs sickness or a gloomy world
                                    for you. Your belief is the only thing that works on the inside and on the outside.
                                    Hence, it is suffice to say that you are not the victim of your genetics. You are
                                    responsible for what unfolds in your life.</span>

                            <p>
                                There is a pressing need to educate masses regarding supporting small-scale businesses as they constitute a major share of the economy. Small <span id="dots">...</span>
                                <span id="more" style="display: none;">scale industries should be reinforced and
                                    promoted to encourage and financially support the businessmen to increase
                                    their productivity and help them expand their line of work. This way, the market
                                    remains regulated and affordable for consumers belonging to each and every
                                    socioeconomic segment. Additionally, the stability of a local business
                                    is directly related with its reach, sales and profit earned. Initiating from the
                                    scratch, with limited resources and capital to sustain long-term, these businesses
                                    are more prone to collapse if not supported. Hence, they
                                    have to work harder to attain limelight and grab audience in the market. The
                                    important thing is that unlike lavish designer brands that loot their clients at
                                    triple rates and preach an extravagant lifestyle, small-scale
                                    businesses charge way less and target a wider population. Let us all educate
                                    ourselves with the idea of simpler living and need-based worthwhile shopping
                                    experience that benefits not only the clients, but facilitates the
                                    entrepreneurs to fuel up their business spaces.

Women get more diverse roles whereas men mostly have the typical torturer part. However, men definitely get paid more than female actors who is at the same level as them.

                <h2>About us</h2>
                <p> Welcome to Wordophic! It is the brainchild of Adnan Khan and Eman Ahmad Shaikh which highlights different flavors of life. As far as its journey is concerned, Wordophic commenced when we identified the lack of space for writers and prosers
                    in publishing industry. "I once tried to publish a magazine but didn 't know the publication process." -Eman Ahmad Shaikh. This idea popped up the next significant step of Wordophic in mind. It took some days in research to grow Pakistan's
                    online ecosystem. Wordophic has dogged belief that the right to be published should not be fourwalled or limited upto certain writing topics but to be secular in writings. So the contents are written by our in-house team which showcases
                    its work and beget healthy discussions. Wordophic also helps students master public writing signature, building self-esteem and learn about literature and narration. . </p>
