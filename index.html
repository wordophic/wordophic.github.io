    <a href="#"> EARLY BIRD OR NIGHT OWL?</a>
    <p>
        It is hard to keep pace with time as the immense work pressure of the current age keeps people occupied. Every “Lark” (person who is efficient in morning) and night owl has his own sleep schedule. <span id="dots26">...</span>
        <span id="more26" style="display: none;"> But due to the stroke of ill-luck, night owls have more chances to adopt serious health complications like diabetes, neurological, gastrointestinal and respiratory disorders. Moving onwards to whatsoever category you belong, always remember to enjoy your magical morning. Motivate yourself to accomplish those peak day tasks which you likely plan to do. It could simply be anything starting from reading a book or enjoying cup of tea. Another tip is to expose yourself to morning light as much as you can, since it plays biologically effective role via head-lighting your brain to start the day. Whatever is your current time for hitting the hay and getting up, don’t be harsh on it. What you need is just to advance 15 minutes early to your bedtime. Similarly, wake up 15 minutes before your normal time. Reducing this gradually is the best way to meet your ideal timings. An ideal sleep cycle maintenance is necessary as the recent research has indicated the risks of heart diseases occurring due to improper sleep-wake schedule. Therefore, form a schedule that fits your every day of the week. Variability of one hour is absorbable on Sundays. However, you can also have a dose of 30 minutes as your siesta time but don’t exceed the time. At nights, try avoiding the contact with electronic screens as they have blue light technology in them which disturbs melatonin. Remember, consistency is the key. Have you breakfast as the king and dinner as a slave.

    <a href="#"> MATERIALISM</a>
    <p>
        We are always chasing gold – excellence – perfection – fantasy! We have this inherent need to show off our wealth to satiate our <span id="dots25">...</span>
        <span id="more25" style="display: none;"> desires to feel superior to others because we have forgotten the ugly truth that one day all our wealth will bury in the dust. We need to spend money to create opportunities for others. But unfortunately, our entirely fake world coexists with hollow men who claim for manhood.

            There are millions of people who don’t have clean water to drink and their living condition is a nightmare. On the flip side, there are masses living the life they desire. They get what they want, exactly as if the world is in their hands. In the first world countries, people worship things, shop lavish, they have big fancy houses, giving soul, mind and emotion to things. Together as a society, we have co-created sucked up world of materialism.
            One day, all these materialistic things will be nothing other than the particle of dust!
            
            Our consciousness about dreaming fantasies will erode with the entangled worthless materialism of the world. We have just a short story of our remaining life left behind. We might become disappointed for what are we living over here, and for what we should be actually living for. We have been consumed with brand culture, new trends, and our obsessed souls. The level to which we are sucked in this materialism is nothing but appalling and shocking. It is time we serve the mother earth and practice gratitude.

    <a href="#">The Influence of Society</a>
    <p>
        No man can survive in an isolation. Man has always been social animal. Life of an individual is all about his social and <span id="dots24">...</span>
        <span id="more24" style="display: none;"> personal values, his failures and distinctions, evils and humanities. As a matter of fact, each and every aspect of life correlated with society is coincident to your surroundings. It is the man who has to bond with society to keep a company that feeds the soul. Similarly, you are recognized by your company. A company, which determines your character, habits, lifestyle, and your personal achievements. It is as important factor as the brain of nervous system. Therefore, one should be wise enough to differentiate between right and wrong, truth and false, and sycophant and supercilious companies. Times change so do people, thus be witty while searching for your confidant. Someone can be inspiring by looks but a black hole by heart. At times, your social circle gives you fake pleasure but later you will thank your self-control. Because your company is the only soul of your body that can either please you with mental fitness or mental illness.  </i> </span>

    <a href="#">Law of Attraction</a>
    <p>
        Life is primarily driven by your belief system. The positive thoughts bring positive experiences to one’s life, and <span id="dots23">...</span>
        <span id="more23" style="display: none;"> vice versa. The further subdivisions of law of attraction are the law of manifestation, magnetism, unwavering desire, delicate balance, harmony, right action and law of universal influence. It states that you will be attracted to the thing you chase, focus on and spend your energy with. The first and foremost thing you need to work with, is time. The more you spend, the wilder will be the results. With respect to psychology, it is called “Internal vs. External Locus of Control.” In other words, it is synonymous with, “you are what you think.” You will only attract to the positivity and productivity if you will focus on it. To construe it up, all you have to do is align your mind, thoughts and feelings for that specific thing. Have faith that you are going to achieve that so soon. Your high or low frequency is the foundation of your results which is a magnetic phenomenon because it is the only mind-body relation that works constantly.  </i> </span>

    <a href="#">Creative Writing</a>
    <p>
        Creative writing is an open art, never four-walled to academics or journalism. It is a <span id="dots22">...</span>
        <span id="more22" style="display: none;"> kind of polished talent that can take you to the heights of glory with due efforts. Creative writers usually begin from short story writing or simple poems to biographies and so on. But they end on their vivid destiny like screen or play writers. At first, content writers may face the mini-problems like vague topics of discussions and the chaotic challenges to begin the creative writing journey. To cope up with this, you can separate a jar, where you can put your chits in it. On those chits, you can write common names of topics like determination, passion, creativity, stress and tension, exercise and whatever topic that interests you. Whenever, you want to write, just pick up any one of those chits and start writing on that particular subject. Remember, your initial lines should be the introduction, middle ones about explanation and conclusion should always be at the end. Students can earn the fame and expertise at very young age, if they are proficient in English. They can also initiate by participating in co-curricular activities like publishing articles in magazines and newspapers. With enough time, you will be pro in writing. Lastly, it is important to have enough reading exposure to build a fine vocabulary to incorporate in your piece of writing.  </i> </span>

    <a href="#">How to Tackle Food Allergies</a>
    <p>
        Food allergy is the hypersensitive immune response of the body due to certain food allergens. The most commonly associated allergy causing foods are fish, <span id="dots21">...</span>
        <span id="more21" style="display: none;"> shellfish, milk, wheat, tree nuts, peanuts, egg and soy. Nowadays, the rate of food allergy has been inclined to level up. As an allergy can be life threatening, visit your nutritionist if you face food discomfort. Food allergy refers to an immune system reaction affecting different body organs. On the flip side, food intolerance has less serious signs and does not involve the immune system. Therefore, it is your task to identify and track the food you take to pinpoint the problem. Once you pinpoint the upsetting food, you should immediately stop consuming that. Play the detective role of yours; make a diet plan or food diary when symptoms occur, and identify the causative food and its allergy symptoms. Moreover, limit those foods which do not upset your gut. You can try food options as well, and acknowledge whether they are right for your stomach or not. You can also help yourself in exploring the diet you take regularly, if signs and symptoms are continual. However, it is necessary to consult your dietician for your diet in order to enjoy a healthy life.   </i> </span>

    <p>
        The impact of the most widely spoken and world-wide recognized language, English, cannot be denied in our lives. As we advance,  <span id="dots19">...</span>
        <span id="more19" style="display: none;"> we step into the corporate world of literature, science and technology, which is dominated by the west. Therefore, it is important to learn the basics of learning English. The most common problem encountered by us is that we know English, but we cannot understand native speakers sometimes, or we are unable to interact with them in a fluent way. Thus, we should work on improving our proficiency in English, the core of western world. If you are passionate, do not just try to read a lot. Because, you may not know the right pronunciation. In this case, listening to English will help you in unexpected ways, as you will learn the correct pronunciation of the words along with heaps of vocabulary that will enhance your fluency. Moreover, translating word to word in your mother language is also smart strategy to learn. Whereas, in regular verbose, it can erode away your interest from reading. You can also use 80/20 rule; 80% of speaking and listening whereas 20% of reading and writing. However, the ratio can vary to 20/80% in case if you are doing any academic research. The next thing is to make it simpler and easier. Do not involve too much in both; having fluency and an accurate grammar. Do not just overcomplicate. Just start speaking it with people, perhaps your friends and siblings. Watch Hollywood TV series and movies, listen to audio videos. And practice it at least 15 minutes every single day. And slow and steady, you will be a pro in English language. </i> </span>

    <a href="#">FORTY RULES OF LOVE</a>
    <p>
         First few golden rules from, “Forty Rules of Love.” <span id="dots14"> ...</span>
        <span id="more14" style="display: none;"> <br>Rule no. 1: “How we see God is a direct reflection of how we see ourselves. If God brings to mind mostly fear and blame, it means there is too much fear and blame welled inside us. If we see God as full of love and compassion, so are we.


            <br>Rule no. 2: “The path to the Truth is a labor of the heart, not of the head. Make your heart your primary guide! Not your mind. Meet, challenge, and ultimately prevail over your nafs with your heart.  Knowing your self will lead you to the knowledge of God.”
            
            
            <br>Rule no. 3: “Each and every reader comprehends the Holy Quran on a different level in tandem with the depth of his understanding. There are four levels of insight. The first level is the outer meaning and it is the one that the majority of the people are content with. Next is the Batini_the inner level. Third, there is the inner of the inner. And the fourth level is so deep it cannot be put into words and is therefore bound to remain indescribable.”
            
            
            <br>Rule no. 4: “You can study God through everything and everyone in the universe, because God is not confined in a mosque, synagogue, or church. But if you are still in need of knowing where exactly His abode is, there is only one place to look for Him: in the heart of a true lover.”
            
            
            <br>Rule no. 5: “Intellect and love are made of different materials. Intellect ties people in knots and risks nothing, but love dissolves all tangles and risks everything. Intellect is always cautious and advises, ‘Beware too much ecstasy,’ whereas love says, ‘Oh, never mind! Take the plunge! Intellect does not easily break down, whereas love can effortlessly reduce itself to rubble. But treasures are hidden among ruins. A broken heart his treasures.”

        <span id="more13" style="display: none;"> diet doesn’t help them to take care of their health. In order to cope up with such circumstances and to have a good health. Here are some of the top suggestions enlisted. No matter how busy you are, science has helped mankind in thousands of ways that are still taken for granted. To construe it up, there exists a rule of prioritizing your work. Firstly, accomplish your top three things mentioned in your to-do list. Secondly, take care about the outings you do. Make sure if enjoying a coffee with your friend is damn important rather working out. Still, if you can’t visit nearest gymnasium then ensure yourself to work-out at home. What it all takes is minimum ten minutes. Devoting four-four minutes to kettlebell exercises and abs work, and two minutes to squats and lunges are all what your body primarily needs. However, you can categorize these according to your most prioritized exercises that can heal you from stress. Activities like early morning walk, gardening, and swimming is the best criterion for your health. As far as healthy eating is concerned, be sure to cook in bulk so that they can be consumed 2-3 days if you are occupied. Tomatoes (good for your heart), spinach (good for your brain), blueberries (good for your cholesterol), salmon (good for weight loss) and pumpkin seeds (good for your memory) are all the required meals for your body fuels. Staying hydrated is yet, another plus point! </span>

                                Work is an exercise for body parts, either physically or mentally. The mental exercises help with the focused work rather than the diffused one. <span id="dots12">...</span>
                                <span id="more12" style="display: none;"> The tip number one to gain concentration for studying is to find pleasure in what you do, regardless of how hard that task is. You can also bring five times more attention to your challenge if you always find yourself at the same place (example, study table), and at the same time (i.e., 10 am everyday) for your study. Your to-do list should always be under your supervision. Cutting your accomplished task can help you in self-motivation. Prioritizing your tasks into categories (urgent : important, urgent : unimportant, not urgent : important and not urgent : unimportant) is also a good source for signifying what is better for you to complete first. Setting up a schedule for your duration of study should always be in your mind, e.g., 1 hour of study with a 5 minute break. This will help you focusing to the level-up. Moreover, staying hydrated and taking glucose-rich diet at breaks can strengthen your attention. Make sure if you are studying offline, then your distraction causing devices are far aside or turned off. Lastly, motivating background music can also help to concentrate better.</span>

             fourth industrial revolution. A.I. means teaching the machine and making the machine becoming smart. An Artificial Intelligent Machine learns by itself and not by explicit programming. Today, machine learning is combating one of the leading causes of blindness, and enabling people with a neurological disease like A-L-S (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) to communicate with their surroundings. A.I. is changing the way we think about the mind and body. 
            <br>Besides, advancement in A.I has made it possible for a machine to compete like an athlete, write a movie, and bring autonomous self-driving cars into existence through reinforcement learning. Currently, NASA is using A.I to build habitat autonomously on Mars using reinforcement learning for the space explorers before they arrive at Mars.
            Today Network Science Institute at Northeastern University in Boston claims that they can model the whole physical world using the available data and computing power.

                            <p>
                                The deeper you think, the more you grow, awaken and explore. The raw thoughts popping in your mind are initially the words without soul that may not make much sense,  <span id="dots10">...</span>
                                <span id="more10" style="display: none;">  but possess immense potential to be transformed into reality. Your thoughts mould into your actions. And with time and consistency, these actions can ultimately manifested as habits. The more actions you do, the more habits you develop, hence transforming your infrequent habits into frequent character. This character ultimately becomes your identity and helps you explore known and the unknown corners of your mystical glory i.e. your absolute destiny. And what is this destiny? It is life!
                                    Thus, the takeaway is that your journey begins with just a thought. It is your thoughts that manufacture your mentality and spirit of life, and subsequently define your journey in life. Think good to have a fortune that traces your eloquence and positivity in life. Remember that you have the power of potential. Your thoughts construct your destiny because and you become what you think.</span>

        Nail is an alpha-keratinous plate found on the tip of fingers and toes. <span id="dots9">...</span>
        <span id="more9" style="display: none;"> This horn-like structure called nail, if defected, can indicate signs of sickness in an individual. Through a nail, its shape, color and surface, a lot of knowledge about underlying health conditions can be discovered. Starting from the extreme positive end; healthy nails are always strong, flat and white or ivory-colored, and never flaky. However, thin pale nails result due to iron deficiency in the body. To construe it up, yellowish color in nails is a result of renal and gastrointestinal tract problems. Moreover, knobbly nails represent an infection in the body. Additionally, lack of zinc, copper and iodine can lead to white dots and streaks on the nails. Crumbling yellow or black nails occur due to fungal infection. Furthermore, brittle nails result from lack of iron and beta-carotene. Pitted nails can be a cause of skin disorder, psoriasis, eczema, or arthritis. Koilonychia is a spooning of nail resulting in raised ridges that can be due to lack of iron and so on.</span>

                                    be influenced by the nature and nurture is what we call phenotype.
                                    A great person is neither he, who defines himself by his materialistic wealth. Nor
                                    he, who compares himself with the others. But the one who has great sense of vision.
                                    Thus, greatness is not specific or limited to anyone
                                    but occupies a commonplace for all. Because all are blessed with potentials and

                                <span id="more5" style="display: none;"> Therefore, try using extra virgin olive oil and

                                    its unprocessed form is present in sugarcane and beet root. It contains phosphorous,

                                Women never enjoyed the prestige and footing as they stand by it now. Even in patriarchal societies, women have been out-performing their due-roles in every walk of life with their <span id="dots3">...</span>

                                    They deserve to be treated with utmost esteem to equip them with social, financial
                                    and matrimonial independence. Their involvement in every field of life outshines
                                    their social
                                    capabilities. Women preserve human race and are entitled to freedom of sentiments to
                                    put forward their opinions on public, legislative and religious matters. Therefore,
                                    they must be designated to pursue their passions.
                                    Without their involvement, the pace of scientific and technological development of
                                    one’s nation would be extremely compromised. The global history is full of the names
                                    of the rising stars who were eminent pundits, poets,
                                    teachers, suffis and businesswomen exiling in their respective fields. Women have
                                    been illuminating their potentials since forever in the form of Hellen Keller,
                                    Benazir Bhutto or Margaret Thatcher. Currently, these
                                    beacons of hope are Hilary Clinton, Angelina Jolie, Malala Yousafzai, Oprah Winfrey,
                                    Jane Goodall, Beyonce, Jacinda Ardern and so on. Even in digital space, they have
                                    earned a significant place by becoming influencers,
                                    fashion-stylists, makeup artists, digital creators and bloggers. In retrospect, the
                                    nations can only prosper by ensuring gender equality and women rights irrespective
                                    of their ethnic, religious or societal details.

                            <p>
                                Our everlasting lust for skin whiteness has originated from prehistoric colonial times. As a result, many individuals in our societies,<span id="dots2">...</span>
                                <span id="more2" style="display: none;"> especially females, are fed with a burden of
                                    attaining white skin tone at the risk of identity crisis. To address our
                                    complex for darker skin, we have been advertising makeup products or cosmetics with
                                    an intention to lighten our original skin color. Is to remember that the brownness
                                    of our skin is a blessing in disguise as our melanin
                                    production is anatural process of shielding our skin. Each of us has been blessed
                                    with the best of our features. And as far as the makeup is concerned, it should only
                                    be done to enhance your features or modify our looks
                                    with elegance. To whiten the skin tone is a fallacy. Excess of anything is
                                    unnecessary and futile. Still, many of our beauty clinics and salons, including the
                                    skin-whitening industry, have overlooked this aspect. They prey
                                    on the insecurities of their customers, loot them and rob them of their identities.
                                    Therefore, it is important to teach our children that they are beautiful no matter
                                    what their skin color is. We have to create awareness
                                    on the concept of “being you.” So why should not we praise Almighty for what we are
                                    born with, rather than pretending to be what we are not!.</span>

                                Everybody has the power of imagination. Your thoughts behold reality and your reality determines your destiny. As you dive deeper <span id="dots1">...</span>
                                <span id="more1" style="display: none;"> into the roots of law of attraction, you
                                    realize that your perception derives your genetic code, thereby controlling your
                                    life. No two witted people can see the world in the same way. Their perceptions can
                                    be accurate or inaccurate, authentic or unauthentic, thus it is more on target to
                                    say that belief controls biology. Your beliefs create
                                    your life. As it is said that: “You create everything that happens to you.” –Jack
                                    Canfield People who passionately long for their dreams are the ones who transform
                                    them into reality. If you choose to be happy, you amplify
                                    your happiness and vibrate at such a frequency that generates influence on the
                                    people around you with your happy aura. On the flip side, obsessing on the negative
                                    energies ultimately constructs sickness or a gloomy world
                                    for you. Your belief is the only thing that works on the inside and on the outside.
                                    Hence, it is suffice to say that you are not the victim of your genetics. You are
                                    responsible for what unfolds in your life.</span>

                            <p>
                                There is a pressing need to educate masses regarding supporting small-scale businesses as they constitute a major share of the economy. Small <span id="dots">...</span>
                                <span id="more" style="display: none;">scale industries should be reinforced and
                                    promoted to encourage and financially support the businessmen to increase
                                    their productivity and help them expand their line of work. This way, the market
                                    remains regulated and affordable for consumers belonging to each and every
                                    socioeconomic segment. Additionally, the stability of a local business
                                    is directly related with its reach, sales and profit earned. Initiating from the
                                    scratch, with limited resources and capital to sustain long-term, these businesses
                                    are more prone to collapse if not supported. Hence, they
                                    have to work harder to attain limelight and grab audience in the market. The
                                    important thing is that unlike lavish designer brands that loot their clients at
                                    triple rates and preach an extravagant lifestyle, small-scale
                                    businesses charge way less and target a wider population. Let us all educate
                                    ourselves with the idea of simpler living and need-based worthwhile shopping
                                    experience that benefits not only the clients, but facilitates the
                                    entrepreneurs to fuel up their business spaces.

                <h2>About us</h2>
                <p> Welcome to Wordophic! It is the brainchild of Adnan Khan and Eman Ahmad Shaikh which highlights different flavors of life. As far as its journey is concerned, Wordophic commenced when we identified the lack of space for writers and prosers
                    in publishing industry. "I once tried to publish a magazine but didn 't know the publication process." -Eman Ahmad Shaikh. This idea popped up the next significant step of Wordophic in mind. It took some days in research to grow Pakistan's
                    online ecosystem. Wordophic has dogged belief that the right to be published should not be fourwalled or limited upto certain writing topics but to be secular in writings. So the contents are written by our in-house team which showcases
                    its work and beget healthy discussions. Wordophic also helps students master public writing signature, building self-esteem and learn about literature and narration. . </p>
