    <a href="#"> A diabetic as carefree even after cheat-meal</a>
    <p>
        It is noticed quite often that diabetics cheat their special dietary regime involuntarily either due to sugary cravings <span id="dots72">...</span>
        <span id="more72" style="display: none;">   or by having a heavy meal that abruptly needs to be purified and balanced. Otherwise, it can be troublesome and disgusting to the utmost degree for health. Just for the information; cheat meals are never bad for those doing keto, it only affects the sufferers of diabetes. Here we are with the schedule for diabetics who are feasible even if they cheat meals. <br>

            1.     Go for a water-fast immediately; no water, lemonade, tea, green tea, coffee, bone broth etc. for 24-36 hours.<br>
            
            2.     Consume protein and fat. Say no to carbohydrates and vegetables.<br>
            
            3.     Liver (mutton liver, chicken liver, etc.) is the best cope-up item to have in a meal.<br>
            
            4.     Taking fermented pickles, enriched with minerals and vitamins, is good for you.<br>
            
            5.     You can make your own keto-burger; add a kabab of beef or chicken with a slice of cheese and a leaf of iceberg over it.<br>
            
            Note: No bread/carbohydrate is allowed to have in it.<br>
            
            6.     Use pink Himalayan salt, nuts and pumpkin seeds.<br>
            
            7.     Have a green-leaf shake; add any leafy vegetable to your drink.<br>
            
            Note: Repeat the schedule for 3-4 days. And later, you are back to the normal routine.

    <a href="#"> How to improve your eyesight and focus?</a>
    <p>
        People are gradually being aware of the eyes-exercises and have begun calling it a natural remedy to cure eyesight problems. If you are facing any problem of near-sightedness or far-sightedness, <span id="dots36">...</span>
        <span id="more36" style="display: none;">  cataracts, or macular-degeneration due to aging, then you are probably going to benefit from the following exercises: <br>

           1) Focus on your point finger a few inches away from your eyes and gradually increase the distance. Remember to keep focusing, and bring that finger slowly towards your eyes. Do it 3 times at least to improve your focus.<br>
            
           2) Create a pinhole with your finger and focus the images through it. This exercise will help you to strengthen your concentration.<br>
            
           3) Focus on your thumb ten-inches away from your eyes for 15 seconds. Then instantly find an object 10-15 feet away and focus on it. Repeat it five times.<br>
            
           4) Trace an imaginary figure 8 with your eyes on the floor. Let the distance be 10 feet. Practice it 30 times, constantly.<br>
            
           5) To cope up with eye-sight problems, the 20-20-20 rule is going to be your savior. Stare/focus on an object every 20 minutes at 20 feet away for 20 seconds.<br>
            
           6) Perform eye yoga frequently. Sit straight with your shoulders off. And rotate your eyes in a clockwise and anticlockwise direction. Remember not to abandon focus. Focus on the image along your direction and continue within the loop.<br>
            
           7) Blink your eyes slowly every time as it keeps moist and permits eligibility to focus longer.<br>
            
           8) Try to write on the walls rotating your lens along the direction of alphabets.<br>
            
           9) Palming your eyes is another efficient tip to relax your eyes. Put your light palms of both hands on your eyes and press them cordially with a light thrust.  <br>

        While having a glance at the inbox of a professional, we often come to know the basic and neglected etiquettes. These are<span id="dots64">...</span>
        <span id="more64" style="display: none;">     not only messages or official conversations but are also a signature of; who you are, where you belong, and what is your upbringing.

            1. Greet (but do not stop after it).<br>
            2. Introduce yourself.<br>
            3. Clarify your problems/offers/collaborations/suggestions in a small pitch, concisely.<br>

            5. Once you are done with the message, show patience and do not overdo it.<br>

                            We are more likely to place chicken on the top shelf of meals. Research shows <span id="dots71">...</span>
                            <span id="more71" style="display: none;">  that white meat, despite the fact that it has plenty of nutrients, can be the biggest cause of health concerns. First and foremost point to ponder is to limitize the quantity of its consumption. Overdose of chicken can lead to food poisoning and diarrhea. Cooking or grilling chicken induces a vast amount of carcinogens that can lead to cancer. Commercial poultry birds are a source of intestinal bacteria like Salmonella, E.coli, and Enterococcus etc. Genetically modified chicken has diverse elements in its fodder that are normally refrained in diets. Vets are usually given arsenic in their diet that is hazardous to cardiac and neurological health. They become a carrier of disease to its consumers and also cause obesity. It is important to acknowledge that commercial poultry breeds can highly risk your health, and can be cruel to your maintained-weight. In fact, free range desi can be the best choice as its alternative ever.

                                Lemon is a miraculous fruit with immense health benefits that cannot be taken for <span id="dots70">...</span>
                                <span id="more70" style="display: none;">  granted. It is quite acidic in nature with 2 pH value. The fruit, juice, and the peel itself is not only a catalyst to your health and beauty but it also works wonders as a medication. Lemon juice helps to diminish vitamin C deficiency. Due to its anti-inflammatory properties, it soothes your digestive and circulatory systems. Today, there exists a broad ideology for putting off weight, looking dapper and staying smart. Thus, this is no brainer to acknowledge lemon as a savior of life. Lemon adds grace to your life, but one better not directly apply to skin especially the facial skin since it can be reactive due to highly acidic nature. In that case, try using it with water to transform its pH value to little alkaline. Moreover, lemon proves to be beneficial to cardiac, renal, and digestive health. It controls weight, and assists the body to fulfill potassium and vitamin B6 requirements. Citrus limon also works miracles for anemia. Therefore, it is much needed to have some lemons at the dining table to let the body get a chance to nourish itself

        <span id="more57" style="display: none;">   relief, relaxation, or reward. One of the main symptoms includes opting junk food which is unhealthy, but at the same time, soothing. After overeating, it becomes a guilt of overdosing and not helping with discarding emotions anymore. Long story short, the problem remains unsolved and the cycle continues. Emotional eating can be controlled with practicing discipline and a healthy lifestyle. Such people, who often are guilty of such practice, need to pursue self-caring routines like regulated day and night schedules with structured eating and relaxing shifts. Additionally, the core of the problem lies in anxiety and stress, for which, the way out is to be easy with different circumstances to apparently gain limited pleasures.

    <a href="#"> Secrets of mindful eating</a>
    <p>
        Mindful eating is to feed your brain while you eat. Whatever the fuel you take into the body, it is not efficient or effective unless and until your brain does not concentrate on it. This  <span id="dots55">...</span>
        <span id="more55" style="display: none;">   practice is often neglected at times when we are in flurry, getting late to work or watching television, etc. Mindful eating is, in point of fact, the celebration of the joyful meal along with knowing the food patterns. These food patterns let you judge yourself about the quantity of food, binge eating, and disciplined food intake. Enlisted below are the few techniques to practice mindful eating:<br>
            1. Mindful eating is easier to practice per meal, either it can be breakfast, brunch, lunch or dinner time.<br>
            2. It is important to shut down all the screens or setting them at flight modes which develop your attention on food and you.<br>
            3. Remember, you are not eating food, rather feeling it. Thus, you need to set up the clock. Let’s say you can extract minimum 20 minutes for the mealtime, knowing that the time can exceed but not subceed.<br>
            4. Meal should be appreciated. Subsequently, you need to eat sluggishly and chew thoroughly as it will maintain your overall health and well-being.<br>
            5. Choose the daily-diary of food that are emotionally comforting and nutritionally healthy.<br>

    <a href="#"> Hour of need for skills</a>
    <p>
        Skills are the need to survive in this technologically fast 21st century. As far as academics are concerned, there are vast fields providing massive scopes and applications, <span id="dots54">...</span>
        <span id="more54" style="display: none;">  popping up in the brains of the youth. Students have to work hard several years to enter their professional life to struggle for bread and butter. Hence, while paying heed to the poverty, we observe; there are many people who cannot complete their education due to the meagre amount of money they possess. Likewise, we come to know about the enthusiastic youth who want to have financial independence. Correspondingly, many females are stepping up to claim their financial stability. In other cases, many parents do not afford to pay the large sum of educational dues, hence hindering the never-ending schooling process of their children.
            Moreover, in the present age of inflation, there is a rapid-fire race of finance. Majority of people cannot earn and are prey to instability and dimmer life.
            As a result, a question pops in our minds, what can be that only source that can take their peaceful dreams to the heights of glory?
            The dignified answer to the above question is ‘exploring skills.’ People who have skills are firm and steady. They have no fears of not getting a job, and hence, lack of earning, because they find peace and poise in their polished talents, skills and creativity. For sure, this is absolutely a great source to showcase talent and let the earning get steady. In a nutshell, the sooner the youth explore their inner-talent and get it polished, the more they would see the prospects of a brighter future.

    <a href="#"> Cross on forgetfulness</a>
    <p>
        Forgetfulness is the major hurdle for the man of today. We learn, we perform tasks, we workout, but eventually we forget, sometimes the most important things. We put <span id="dots53">...</span>
        <span id="more53" style="display: none;">  something somewhere and after a short span of time, we are again the victim of blunder headedness.
            As far as the term forgetfulness is concerned, a person can be a prey of it only in case of Alzheimer, or Dementia that usually occurs after 60 years of age. Before 60 years, there doesn’t exist a lapse of memory. Subsequently, the only cause of forgetfulness, or blunder headedness, is the lack of attention while working or performing multiple tasks at once without any interest. Moreover, it is often observed that while offering prayer, we lose attention mentally because of brainstorming. Remember! The proportionality of the two terms; work and attention, is directly correlated. Consciousness and attention are the two tools we can use to improve our memory. Besides, meditation also helps you to fix the memory disorders and build concentration. Thus, it is important to practice memory building exercises that build our focus and help us master our lifestyle with a wide array of blessings, consciousness and memory.

        <span id="more52" style="display: none;">  of healthy bones and teeth. It is a prohormone that protects from numerous diseases such as diabetes type 1, cancer, flu, high blood pressure, weak pregnancy and immune disorders etc. Despite the presence of vitamin D in a variety of foods like soy milk, yogurt, cheese, egg yolk, beef liver, orange juice, soy cereals, fatty fish, salmon, and mushrooms, our body can be prone to its deficiency. Lack of vitamin D causes osteomalacia that leads to muscular weakness, frequent body pain, fatigue and depression. To combat its deficiency, it is indispensable to have exposure to sunlight. Likewise, vitamin D injections can also be an alternative choice for people working indoors.

    <a href="#"> PSYCHIATRY vs. CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY</a>
    <p>
        The two fields, psychiatry and clinical psychology, are correlated with respect to mental health professions. While studying psychiatry, we come to know about its diverse perspectives. Psychiatrists<span id="dots51">...</span>
        <span id="more51" style="display: none;">   are medically trained doctors or physicians, who are done with their five years of med-schooling, and four years of residency (FCPS) or diploma. In fact, they treat patients with their psycho-pharmacological medicines. Patients pursue their 12-24 invariable sessions under kind supervision of psychiatrists.
            Contrary to it, clinical psychology is a study of human behavior, mind sciences and modalities of psychotherapy via analysis. A clinical psychologist diagnoses patients and implies talk-therapy. He researches and applies strategies on humanistic models and promotes awareness to lighten up the lives of patients with bright options to heal their mental illness. The basic tools for a clinical psychologist are autonomy, empowerment, and internal strength. Hence, the two professions are different but equally important in ensuring mental health, which is unfortunately, still a stigma, in the 21st century.

        <span id="more47" style="display: none;">   skin. When the various pressure points on the skin are kept pressed, they induce relief to different parts of the body. Basically, the region you press is a pressure point of any organ or gland of the trunk. For instance, the thumbs of your feet are related to the pineal and pituitary glands. Similarly, each and every part of your hands and feet are associated with any organ or a part. Acupuncture gives relief from pain, inhibits stress-mechanisms and releases toxins. Therefore, it is necessary to drink a glass of water after practicing acupuncture. It will help in flushing out various toxins. Any dehydration-causing agent is its worst culprit. Correspondingly, one can perform it once in a day or so, depending upon the severity of the disease.

There is no exact cure for such diseases, but they can be controlled with antibiotics, change in life-style or sometimes surgery (in IBD). However, pain can be felt in the whole abdominal region. A doctor can diagnose the kind of disorder due to specific localization of pain. For instance, pain in the lower-left region identifies IBS. While, left-sided pains are a definitive cause of ulcerative colitis (IBD).

Educate them about right and wrong. Because, a person doing your things, bound to your orders, is not your property but your obligation to take care of. If such ethics are not acted upon, it would make this world deprived of kindness and mercy. It is important to note that humanity is the essence of life. Thus, we should never violate someone’s rights.

Therefore, while throwing your face masks away in the bins, make sure to cut off their plastic straps (worn around ears). Additionally, wearing single-use plastic masks are not your savior against viruses. Switch to fabric/cloth masks which are ten times better for your health and safety measures.

    <a href="#"> Alcoholism</a>
    <p>
        Alcoholism is a drinking issue, characterized by an uncontrollable desire to binge drink alcohol. Like other addictions, it has roots in early life relational problems and traumas. People are <span id="dots37">...</span>
        <span id="more37" style="display: none;">  likely to become alcoholics if they cannot resist from strain, low self-esteem, depression or any other psychological problem. However, family history is another cause for alcoholism amongst people who have a parent or close relative who is an alcoholic or has been alcoholic for some reason. Alcoholics practice alcoholism as a primary obligation. An abundance of alcohol leads to hepatitis, cirrhosis, jaundice, high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke and cancer. While paying heed to its cure, alcoholics should be helped with following a withdrawal schedule with a number of days and times to drink. They should try to omit at least two days to abandon alcoholism. Such people are advised not to keep alcohol at home as it will limit them to its reach. Another key point is to keep oneself busy and be persistent in withdrawal of this urge. A good long term consistent therapy from a clinical psychologist would also work better as it would certainly heal emotional wounds.

    <a href="#"> The harmful effects of carbonated beverages</a>
    <p>
        Americans take about 13 billion gallons of fizzy drinks per year. Fizzy drinks can be taken temporarily as an alternative to water, but sodas typically contain carbon dioxide, sugar, phosphoric<span id="dots35">...</span>
        <span id="more35" style="display: none;">  and citric acid, sodium, and excess calories. These components harm the body by causing problems like dehydration (dry skin and acne), calcium depletion, weight gain, high blood sugar, dementia, strokes and depression that can further lead to health complications i.e., liver damage and aging. Beverages purely contain large amounts of sugars that are turned into fats in the body, leading to belly fat accumulation. Moreover, sodas contain no nutrients. Hence, they just contribute to unnecessary calories, and resist your body from regulating the number of calories you eat and burn. Excess sugars is the principal cause of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Sugary drinks also cause heart diseases and cancer. Likewise, postmenopausal women who are more likely to drink carbonated beverages can be prey to endometrial cancer. Besides, fizzy drinks are a disaster to your dental health and bones (gout; due to accumulation of uric acid crystals). To conclude, it is important to abandon these drinks as soon as possible as they are injurious to our health. Let’s give your body a chance to heal and detoxify. Eat healthy!

Whereas, the other harms include the low fertility rate, blood and cervical cancer, miscarriage and birth defects due to affected sperms in man. On the flip side, women-smokers usually face the problems like stillbirth, preterm, low birth weight, and orofacial clefts in infants. Moreover, bones are severely weakened due to smoking. Additional signs include infected gums, cataracts, type 2 diabetes mellitus, early menopause, rheumatoid arthritis, pneumonia, skin problems, ulcers, inflammation, high cholesterol, loss of appetite, bad breath, and loss of immunity. There also develops the risk of death, most smokers fail to reach their 65 years of age. To sum it up, lungs have magical ability to cure, but only if you stop smoking. Hence, it is important to either reduce smoking or entirely eliminate it. Nicotine takes 72 hours to get out of your body, thus, a person can escape from his cravings for nicotine in 12 days. Occasional smokers are exposed to less harm. While, a heavy smoker who quits smoking later halves his risk of death and rejuvenates his body organs back to normal within 5-10 years.

Apples stimulate alkaline saliva that helps in cleaning of teeth. In addition, they also reduce visceral belly fat. Furthermore, dietary addition of apples may contribute to inducing a glow on your skin. It has been a universal fact that one should consume more than 1 fruit servings on the table. The perfect time for fruits is in the morning after taking a glass of water. Whenever taken, try not to peel off apples as the roughage in it is the cleaner of your intestine. Remember that apple itself is the best choice. Make sure to consume it in its original form rather than a juice that halves the nutrients than before.

In addition to it, sleeping a lot is also a symptom in later stages. As a matter of fact, taste buds are diminished with age so people with dementia may like to have heavy or sweet treats. Highly processed food, refined carbs, sugary drinks, aspartame, alcohol and fish high in mercury are highly causative agents for this disease. Whereas, leafy green veggies, berries, nuts, omega 3, spices and seeds are helpful in fighting against it. Cheese can also lead to impaired memory. Lastly, people with dementia need to be physically active and avoid things like smoking, unhealthy foods, alcohol and smoking in order to get rid of the disease.

            A great person is neither he, who defines himself by his materialistic wealth. Nor

            Thus, greatness is not specific or limited to anyone

        Sleeping hours might vary from an hour to hour. Such differences of time can be regulated by practicing several enlisted activities.

        <span id="more69" style="display: none;">   exactly maintain your sleep hours every day. Somehow, you need to show patience to yourself. For this, you can arrange the bedtime environment by switching off lights. It is necessarily important to avoid exertion when you are near to hit the hay as it will energize you, escaping from sleep. Another secret of supervising sleep hours (that are ultimately the fitness regulator) is to avoid intake of food. Besides the fact that the environment has a great impact, it is vital to eat early, exercise at daytime, and give a stimulus of sleep to your brain at night. This stimulus can opt any form like low light, relaxed body posture, and no noise. Likewise, the stimulus of sleep-time can also be any activity like reading a book daily in a relaxed-spine position before going to bed, and so on. These activities, when performed daily, will showcase your brain the time to have forty winks.

        <span id="more27" style="display: none;"> •	If someone has something you want, be as excited as though you have it. If you feel love for it, you are bringing the same thing to you.<br>


            •	When you see the things you want, you are as the same frequency as those things.<br>
            
            
            •	Life’s catalogue contains the things you don’t love, so don’t choose them by giving bad feelings.<br>
            
            
            •	Turn away for the things you don’t love and don’t give them any feeling. Instead say yes when you see something you love.<br>
            
            
            •	The law of attraction is responding to your feelings! It’s only what you give that counts. The law of attraction – is the law of you.<br>
            
            
            •	Give judgement and criticism and you give it to yourself. Give love and appreciation to another person or anything, and you give it to yourself.<br>
            
            
            •	When people see a lack of anything, it’s simply a lack of love.<br>
            
            
            •	It’s your beliefs, true or untrue, that form your world.<br>
            
            
            
•	Your imagination is more real than the world you see, because the world you see comes from what you imagine and believe! What you believe and feel to be true is what will be your life.<br>


•	Whatever story you tell, whether good or bad, will be the story of your life. So start telling the story of your amazing life, and the law of attraction must make sure you receive it.<br>

    <a href="#"> EARLY BIRD OR NIGHT OWL?</a>
    <p>
        It is hard to keep pace with time as the immense work pressure of the current age keeps people occupied. Every “Lark” (person who is efficient in morning) and night owl has his own sleep schedule. <span id="dots26">...</span>
        <span id="more26" style="display: none;"> But due to the stroke of ill-luck, night owls have more chances to adopt serious health complications like diabetes, neurological, gastrointestinal and respiratory disorders. Moving onwards to whatsoever category you belong, always remember to enjoy your magical morning. Motivate yourself to accomplish those peak day tasks which you likely plan to do. It could simply be anything starting from reading a book or enjoying cup of tea. Another tip is to expose yourself to morning light as much as you can, since it plays biologically effective role via head-lighting your brain to start the day. Whatever is your current time for hitting the hay and getting up, don’t be harsh on it. What you need is just to advance 15 minutes early to your bedtime. Similarly, wake up 15 minutes before your normal time. Reducing this gradually is the best way to meet your ideal timings. An ideal sleep cycle maintenance is necessary as the recent research has indicated the risks of heart diseases occurring due to improper sleep-wake schedule. Therefore, form a schedule that fits your every day of the week. Variability of one hour is absorbable on Sundays. However, you can also have a dose of 30 minutes as your siesta time but don’t exceed the time. At nights, try avoiding the contact with electronic screens as they have blue light technology in them which disturbs melatonin. Remember, consistency is the key. Have you breakfast as the king and dinner as a slave.

        <span id="more25" style="display: none;"> desires to feel superior to others because we have forgotten the ugly truth that one day all our wealth will bury in the dust. We need to spend money to create opportunities for others. But unfortunately, our entirely fake world coexists with hollow men who claim for manhood.

            There are millions of people who don’t have clean water to drink and their living condition is a nightmare. On the flip side, there are masses living the life they desire. They get what they want, exactly as if the world is in their hands. In the first world countries, people worship things, shop lavish, they have big fancy houses, giving soul, mind and emotion to things. Together as a society, we have co-created sucked up world of materialism.
            One day, all these materialistic things will be nothing other than the particle of dust!
            
            Our consciousness about dreaming fantasies will erode with the entangled worthless materialism of the world. We have just a short story of our remaining life left behind. We might become disappointed for what are we living over here, and for what we should be actually living for. We have been consumed with brand culture, new trends, and our obsessed souls. The level to which we are sucked in this materialism is nothing but appalling and shocking. It is time we serve the mother earth and practice gratitude.

With respect to psychology, it is called “Internal vs. External Locus of Control.” In other words, it is synonymous with, “you are what you think.” You will only attract to the positivity and productivity if you will focus on it. To construe it up, all you have to do is align your mind, thoughts and feelings for that specific thing. Have faith that you are going to achieve that so soon.

To cope up with this, you can separate a jar, where you can put your chits in it. On those chits, you can write common names of topics like determination, passion, creativity, stress and tension, exercise and whatever topic that interests you. Whenever, you want to write, just pick up any one of those chits and start writing on that particular subject. Remember, your initial lines should be the introduction, middle ones about explanation and conclusion should always be at the end. Students can earn the fame and expertise at very young age, if they are proficient in English. They can also initiate by participating in co-curricular activities like publishing articles in magazines and newspapers. With enough time, you will be pro in writing. Lastly, it is important to have enough reading exposure to build a fine vocabulary to incorporate in your piece of writing.  </i> </span>

        <span id="more21" style="display: none;"> shellfish, milk, wheat, tree nuts, peanuts, egg and soy. Nowadays, the rate of food allergy has been inclined to level up. As an allergy can be life threatening, visit your nutritionist if you face food discomfort. Food allergy refers to an immune system reaction affecting different body organs. On the flip side, food intolerance has less serious signs and does not involve the immune system. Therefore, it is your task to identify and track the food you take to pinpoint the problem. Once you pinpoint the upsetting food, you should immediately stop consuming that. Play the detective role of yours; make a diet plan or food diary when symptoms occur, and identify the causative food and its allergy symptoms. Moreover, limit those foods which do not upset your gut. You can try food options as well, and acknowledge whether they are right for your stomach or not. You can also help yourself in exploring the diet you take regularly, if signs and symptoms are continual. However, it is necessary to consult your dietician for your diet in order to enjoy a healthy life.   </i> </span>

    <a href="#">How to improve your English language</a>
    <p>
        The impact of the most widely spoken and world-wide recognized language, English, cannot be denied in our lives. As we advance,  <span id="dots19">...</span>
        <span id="more19" style="display: none;"> we step into the corporate world of literature, science and technology, which is dominated by the west. Therefore, it is important to learn the basics of learning English. The most common problem encountered by us is that we know English, but we cannot understand native speakers sometimes, or we are unable to interact with them in a fluent way. Thus, we should work on improving our proficiency in English, the core of western world. If you are passionate, do not just try to read a lot. Because, you may not know the right pronunciation. In this case, listening to English will help you in unexpected ways, as you will learn the correct pronunciation of the words along with heaps of vocabulary that will enhance your fluency. Moreover, translating word to word in your mother language is also smart strategy to learn. Whereas, in regular verbose, it can erode away your interest from reading. You can also use 80/20 rule; 80% of speaking and listening whereas 20% of reading and writing. However, the ratio can vary to 20/80% in case if you are doing any academic research. The next thing is to make it simpler and easier. Do not involve too much in both; having fluency and an accurate grammar. Do not just overcomplicate. Just start speaking it with people, perhaps your friends and siblings. Watch Hollywood TV series and movies, listen to audio videos. And practice it at least 15 minutes every single day. And slow and steady, you will be a pro in English language. </i> </span>

    <a href="#">BINGE EATING DISORDER</a>
    <p>
        Binge eating is the form of eating that quenches the cravings by inappropriately taking big quantities of food. <span id="dots16"> ...</span>
        <span id="more16" style="display: none;">  The specific quality of this kind of craving is that it cannot help someone   resisting from enjoying the meals. And at the near-end, there comes a point when one becomes guilty about himself on eating too much and at lack of self-control. However, that is comforting at the moment. But, on the flip side, man regrets about being flooded with food later. The emotional symptoms included are; relieving the tension by taking food, embarrassment over the quantity being taken and desperation to control weight and eating habits. However, you can remove this temptation with healthy eating. Instead of eating mindlessly,  be a mindful eater. Learn to tolerate and develop healthier lifestyle. Be punctual in exercising, sleeping and social routines. Furthermore, in case if you encounter your loved one facing the similar situation, try to be supportive rather than being judgmental. And, set up a good example for them!</i> </span>

    <a href="#">FORTY RULES OF LOVE</a>
    <p>
         First few golden rules from, “Forty Rules of Love.” <span id="dots14"> ...</span>
        <span id="more14" style="display: none;"> <br>Rule no. 1: “How we see God is a direct reflection of how we see ourselves. If God brings to mind mostly fear and blame, it means there is too much fear and blame welled inside us. If we see God as full of love and compassion, so are we.


            <br>Rule no. 2: “The path to the Truth is a labor of the heart, not of the head. Make your heart your primary guide! Not your mind. Meet, challenge, and ultimately prevail over your nafs with your heart.  Knowing your self will lead you to the knowledge of God.”
            
            
            <br>Rule no. 3: “Each and every reader comprehends the Holy Quran on a different level in tandem with the depth of his understanding. There are four levels of insight. The first level is the outer meaning and it is the one that the majority of the people are content with. Next is the Batini_the inner level. Third, there is the inner of the inner. And the fourth level is so deep it cannot be put into words and is therefore bound to remain indescribable.”
            
            
            <br>Rule no. 4: “You can study God through everything and everyone in the universe, because God is not confined in a mosque, synagogue, or church. But if you are still in need of knowing where exactly His abode is, there is only one place to look for Him: in the heart of a true lover.”
            
            
            <br>Rule no. 5: “Intellect and love are made of different materials. Intellect ties people in knots and risks nothing, but love dissolves all tangles and risks everything. Intellect is always cautious and advises, ‘Beware too much ecstasy,’ whereas love says, ‘Oh, never mind! Take the plunge! Intellect does not easily break down, whereas love can effortlessly reduce itself to rubble. But treasures are hidden among ruins. A broken heart his treasures.”

    <a href="#">How Busy People Manage their Health?</a>
    <p>
         Majority of people are facing the issue to supervise their health due to reasons that vary in tones. Either, they face the time shortage or their fragile imbalanced <span id="dots13"> ...</span>
        <span id="more13" style="display: none;"> diet doesn’t help them to take care of their health. In order to cope up with such circumstances and to have a good health. Here are some of the top suggestions enlisted. No matter how busy you are, science has helped mankind in thousands of ways that are still taken for granted. To construe it up, there exists a rule of prioritizing your work. Firstly, accomplish your top three things mentioned in your to-do list. Secondly, take care about the outings you do. Make sure if enjoying a coffee with your friend is damn important rather working out. Still, if you can’t visit nearest gymnasium then ensure yourself to work-out at home. What it all takes is minimum ten minutes. Devoting four-four minutes to kettlebell exercises and abs work, and two minutes to squats and lunges are all what your body primarily needs. However, you can categorize these according to your most prioritized exercises that can heal you from stress. Activities like early morning walk, gardening, and swimming is the best criterion for your health. As far as healthy eating is concerned, be sure to cook in bulk so that they can be consumed 2-3 days if you are occupied. Tomatoes (good for your heart), spinach (good for your brain), blueberries (good for your cholesterol), salmon (good for weight loss) and pumpkin seeds (good for your memory) are all the required meals for your body fuels. Staying hydrated is yet, another plus point! </span>

    <a href="#">WAYS FOR FOCUSED STUDY</a>
    <p>
        Work is an exercise for body parts, either physically or mentally. The mental exercises help with the focused work rather than the diffused one. <span id="dots12">...</span>
        <span id="more12" style="display: none;"> The tip number one to gain concentration for studying is to find pleasure in what you do, regardless of how hard that task is. You can also bring five times more attention to your challenge if you always find yourself at the same place (example, study table), and at the same time (i.e., 10 am everyday) for your study. Your to-do list should always be under your supervision. Cutting your accomplished task can help you in self-motivation. Prioritizing your tasks into categories (urgent : important, urgent : unimportant, not urgent : important and not urgent : unimportant) is also a good source for signifying what is better for you to complete first. Setting up a schedule for your duration of study should always be in your mind, e.g., 1 hour of study with a 5 minute break. This will help you focusing to the level-up. Moreover, staying hydrated and taking glucose-rich diet at breaks can strengthen your attention. Make sure if you are studying offline, then your distraction causing devices are far aside or turned off. Lastly, motivating background music can also help to concentrate better.</span>

             fourth industrial revolution. A.I. means teaching the machine and making the machine becoming smart. An Artificial Intelligent Machine learns by itself and not by explicit programming. Today, machine learning is combating one of the leading causes of blindness, and enabling people with a neurological disease like A-L-S (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) to communicate with their surroundings. A.I. is changing the way we think about the mind and body. 
            <br>Besides, advancement in A.I has made it possible for a machine to compete like an athlete, write a movie, and bring autonomous self-driving cars into existence through reinforcement learning. Currently, NASA is using A.I to build habitat autonomously on Mars using reinforcement learning for the space explorers before they arrive at Mars.
            Today Network Science Institute at Northeastern University in Boston claims that they can model the whole physical world using the available data and computing power.
            
            <br>Suppose you want to dive into A.I. and wish to learn about how to integrate A.I. applications in your daily routine tasks or your business. In that case, there is a free course offered through Coursera Inc by Professor Andrew Ng. To see course details,

                                The deeper you think, the more you grow, awaken and explore. The raw thoughts popping in your mind are initially the words without soul that may not make much sense,  <span id="dots10">...</span>

And with time and consistency, these actions can ultimately manifested as habits. The more actions you do, the more habits you develop, hence transforming your infrequent habits into frequent character. This character ultimately becomes your identity and helps you explore known and the unknown corners of your mystical glory i.e. your absolute destiny. And what is this destiny? It is life!
                                    Thus, the takeaway is that your journey begins with just a thought. It is your thoughts that manufacture your mentality and spirit of life, and subsequently define your journey in life. Think good to have a fortune that traces your eloquence and positivity in life. Remember that you have the power of potential. Your thoughts construct your destiny because and you become what you think.</span>

Through a nail, its shape, color and surface, a lot of knowledge about underlying health conditions can be discovered. Starting from the extreme positive end; healthy nails are always strong, flat and white or ivory-colored, and never flaky. However, thin pale nails result due to iron deficiency in the body. To construe it up, yellowish color in nails is a result of renal and gastrointestinal tract problems. Moreover, knobbly nails represent an infection in the body. Additionally, lack of zinc, copper and iodine can lead to white dots and streaks on the nails. Crumbling yellow or black nails occur due to fungal infection. Furthermore, brittle nails result from lack of iron and beta-carotene. Pitted nails can be a cause of skin disorder, psoriasis, eczema, or arthritis. Koilonychia is a spooning of nail resulting in raised ridges that can be due to lack of iron and so on.</span>

    <a href="#">3 important dietary changes to adopt</a>
    <p>
        Refined Oils: Refined vegetable oils are processed edibles manufactured from chemical processing which makes for their nature acidic and bleached transparent color. These oils can be unhealthy for our bodies.<span id="dots5">...</span>
        <span id="more5" style="display: none;"> Therefore, try using extra virgin olive oil and
            coconut oil, or ghee. Although saturated fats can contribute to heart diseases if
            the cholesterol level of the body is not regulated. But they are relatively
            healthier, with
            no side effects. White Sugar: White sugar is also known as ‘white poison’. Sugar, in
            its unprocessed form is present in sugarcane and beet root. It contains phosphorous,
            sulfur, zinc, vitamins, natural enzymes, and
            other trace elements. The added chemicals and the bleaching agents during its
            processing result in its crystal white color, while causing mineral losses. To
            construe it up, excess sugar intake can cause obesity and
            even diabetes. As an alternate to white sugar, use ‘Gurr’ or ‘Shakkar’. All-purpose
            White Flour: All-purpose white flour (aka maida) consists of smallest particle size
            and hence, minimal fibre. Consequently, it is more
            prone to intensify IBS and may stick to the intestinal walls, thus affecting the
            whole digestion process. You can use whole grain flour or chakki-aatta to substitute
            for a healthier living.</span>

    <a href="#">Taking care of mental health</a>
    <p>
        Just like our physical health, mental fitness plays quite a significant part in our well-being. World could turn into a cringy place if it is not fed enough care.<span id="dots4">...</span><span id="more4" style="display: none;"> What is considered more
            of a taboo can unfortunately, at times, plunge us into madness,
            depression or can even lead to agony of suicide. However, there are certain measures
            that can treat your panic or depressive episodes including exercise, meditation,
            staying hydrated, getting enough sunshine, getting fresh
            air, taking a cold shower, getting at least 6 to 8 hours of sleep, and lastly,
            engaging your mind to maximize your productivity. Similarly, the edibles for it may
            include anything that inclines the dopamine level (any-thing
            tasty and toothsome). Because the sweetness at the end becomes the only reliable
            source for take-it-easy-way. After all, you have to love yourself to be a warrior of
            light and kindness to this world. Thus, mental and emotional
            peace is immensely important for a person to find the passion and fulfill the
            meaning of his life, and make this world a better place.

    <p>
        Women never enjoyed the prestige and footing as they stand by it now. Even in patriarchal societies, women have been out-performing their due-roles in every walk of life with their <span id="dots3">...</span>
        <span id="more3" style="display: none;">twofold productive capacity as compared to men.
            They deserve to be treated with utmost esteem to equip them with social, financial
            and matrimonial independence. Their involvement in every field of life outshines
            their social
            capabilities. Women preserve human race and are entitled to freedom of sentiments to
            put forward their opinions on public, legislative and religious matters. Therefore,
            they must be designated to pursue their passions.
            Without their involvement, the pace of scientific and technological development of
            one’s nation would be extremely compromised. The global history is full of the names
            of the rising stars who were eminent pundits, poets,
            teachers, suffis and businesswomen exiling in their respective fields. Women have
            been illuminating their potentials since forever in the form of Hellen Keller,
            Benazir Bhutto or Margaret Thatcher. Currently, these
            beacons of hope are Hilary Clinton, Angelina Jolie, Malala Yousafzai, Oprah Winfrey,
            Jane Goodall, Beyonce, Jacinda Ardern and so on. Even in digital space, they have
            earned a significant place by becoming influencers,
            fashion-stylists, makeup artists, digital creators and bloggers. In retrospect, the
            nations can only prosper by ensuring gender equality and women rights irrespective
            of their ethnic, religious or societal details.

    <p>
        Our everlasting lust for skin whiteness has originated from prehistoric colonial times. As a result, many individuals in our societies,<span id="dots2">...</span>
        <span id="more2" style="display: none;"> especially females, are fed with a burden of
            attaining white skin tone at the risk of identity crisis. To address our
            complex for darker skin, we have been advertising makeup products or cosmetics with
            an intention to lighten our original skin color. Is to remember that the brownness
            of our skin is a blessing in disguise as our melanin
            production is anatural process of shielding our skin. Each of us has been blessed
            with the best of our features. And as far as the makeup is concerned, it should only
            be done to enhance your features or modify our looks
            with elegance. To whiten the skin tone is a fallacy. Excess of anything is
            unnecessary and futile. Still, many of our beauty clinics and salons, including the
            skin-whitening industry, have overlooked this aspect. They prey
            on the insecurities of their customers, loot them and rob them of their identities.
            Therefore, it is important to teach our children that they are beautiful no matter
            what their skin color is. We have to create awareness
            on the concept of “being you.” So why should not we praise Almighty for what we are
            born with, rather than pretending to be what we are not!.</span>

    <p>
        Everybody has the power of imagination. Your thoughts behold reality and your reality determines your destiny. As you dive deeper <span id="dots1">...</span>
        <span id="more1" style="display: none;"> into the roots of law of attraction, you
            realize that your perception derives your genetic code, thereby controlling your
            life. No two witted people can see the world in the same way. Their perceptions can
            be accurate or inaccurate, authentic or unauthentic, thus it is more on target to
            say that belief controls biology. Your beliefs create
            your life. As it is said that: “You create everything that happens to you.” –Jack
            Canfield People who passionately long for their dreams are the ones who transform
            them into reality. If you choose to be happy, you amplify
            your happiness and vibrate at such a frequency that generates influence on the
            people around you with your happy aura. On the flip side, obsessing on the negative
            energies ultimately constructs sickness or a gloomy world
            for you. Your belief is the only thing that works on the inside and on the outside.
            Hence, it is suffice to say that you are not the victim of your genetics. You are
            responsible for what unfolds in your life.</span>

        There is a pressing need to educate masses regarding supporting small-scale businesses as they constitute a major share of the economy. Small <span id="dots">...</span>
        <span id="more" style="display: none;">scale industries should be reinforced and
            promoted to encourage and financially support the businessmen to increase
            their productivity and help them expand their line of work. This way, the market
            remains regulated and affordable for consumers belonging to each and every
            socioeconomic segment. Additionally, the stability of a local business
            is directly related with its reach, sales and profit earned. Initiating from the
            scratch, with limited resources and capital to sustain long-term, these businesses
            are more prone to collapse if not supported. Hence, they
            have to work harder to attain limelight and grab audience in the market. The
            important thing is that unlike lavish designer brands that loot their clients at
            triple rates and preach an extravagant lifestyle, small-scale
            businesses charge way less and target a wider population. Let us all educate
            ourselves with the idea of simpler living and need-based worthwhile shopping
            experience that benefits not only the clients, but facilitates the
            entrepreneurs to fuel up their business spaces.

Juices are an additional effective and liable source of fitness for your vision and these may include grapefruit, lemon and orange juices. You also need to bless your eyes with beef, eggs, whole grains, almonds and water. Last but not the least is Gamma-Linolenic acid to cure dry-eyes problems.

    <a href="#"> Factors affecting aging</a>
    <p>
        Aging is the most anxiety-causing factor in adults of the present day. There are many factors affecting aging that briefly include water, food, sleep, functionality, mental state and unnecessary fears. Following<span id="dots67">...</span>
        <span id="more67" style="display: none;">    are the succinct descriptions of the factors:<br>
            1. Water is an essential element of life. It eradicates all the signs of dryness. Therefore, intake of water is inversely proportional to aging. The more the water is taken, the less it is susceptible to aging.<br>
            2. Food is fuel. To combat aging, one needs to regulate intake of three respective colors; green, yellow and white. Green color is an evidence of chlorophyll which is found in various fruits and vegetables. Yellow color presents food rich in enzymes and vitamin B complex, whereas white color resonates with an alkaline and fibre-rich diet.<br>
            3. Fitness is a part of relaxation and sleep. It is better not to sleep too much or too less, but it must be for 7-8 hours in accordance with nature's biological clock. Hence, lawbreaking (being a night owl or snoozing in day) is prohibited.<br>
            4. Make sure to exercise and to perform stretches so that activity of muscles does not fade away.<br>
            5. Mental state is always given a priority to maintain its fitness and proactivity. One needs to make sure about his healthy and peaceful mindset. Because, the one with depression and anxiety will be the worst culprit.<br>
            6. Lastly, but most importantly is the factor of not keeping unnatural fear of aging. It has been researched that the people who continuously fear about aging are usually the prey to it.<br>
            
            Enlisted above are the features of aging and we are in dire need of tips permitting us to enjoy teen-age once again. Therefore, we need to legalize healthy lifestyles, and to have benefits from natural sources.

            1. Sit straight!<br>
            2. It is necessary to strengthen up muscles especially, the spinal and abdominal muscles.<br>
            3.  Exercise; lay down on an object placed at your back just at the level of your navel, join your pinkies of hands just above your head and toes of your feet below.<br>
            4. Spine and lower back workouts will certainly let your joints thank you.<br>
            5. If you wear a bag, make sure to put the weight over both of your shoulders.<br>
            6. While using the screen, there should always be a 30cm distance between your eyes and the electronic object.<br>
            
            Don’ts:<br>
            1. Avoid a slouched posture as it crushes the nerve-endings.<br>
            2.  Refrain from hunch-posture that induces pressure on organs; disturbing normal working of heart, abdomen and limbs.<br>
            3. Desist from saggy position as it can distort internal organs from their origins.<br>
            4. Don’t lower your head while reading a book or using a phone.<br>
            5. While using the keyboard of your system, make sure not to tilt your 90 degree angle of hands.<br>
            6. Do not lean over the steering while driving. Instead, pull your seat towards it and drive with ease.

    <a href="#"> Today’s problem: Diverting concentration</a>
    <p>
        Concentration is a tool to build attention. While paying attention, man’s focus is somehow disrupted by several distractions and it can be anything <span id="dots61">...</span>
        <span id="more61" style="display: none;">   like brainstorming, notifications on mobile, etc. Thus, to deal with distraction, one needs to exercise mindfulness in eating, meditation, attentive listening, reading slowly, memorizing stuff, etc. as these exercises are steadily going to empower your concentration. Additionally, train your mind in brainy games like sudoku, chess, etc. As you know, the brain needs special care through proper sleep, time with nature, music, and overall well-being.

    <a href="#"> Exertion shouts out loud</a>
    <p>
        Physical exertion means an effort to pull, push or lift a body part or any object in order to strengthen muscles. As activity of muscles fades away if, somehow, <span id="dots60">...</span>
        <span id="more60" style="display: none;">   they are no longer brought in workouts. Thus, physical exertion is of great importance since it helps against aging, and preserves bone density. Exertion also creates antibodies against several chronic diseases and improves sleep schedules. Equally, the essence of functionality is directly proportional to fitness, therefore, patients of depression are always advised for the functional exercises so that their bodies could perform at a metabolically active rate. Moreover, exertion has an endless list of health benefits. It ensures the quality of life for diversity of people pursuing little to no effort, or hard climbing exercises. Briefly, for the people who are not fascinated by exercises can spare some time for no effort-exercises like controlled breathing through the nose, talking freely and comfortably, taking breaks while talking and so on.

    <a href="#"> Grammar: The gateway to English</a>
    <p>
        English grammar is another core-part of the language besides literature. Normally, it is observed that we pay heed to the speaking skills like fluency, vast diction <span id="dots59">...</span>
        <span id="more59" style="display: none;">   and verbose etc. Whereas, the grammar is usually not stressed upon enough. While writing and speaking, grammar always remains under observation of the checker or listener.  It has a vast syllabi composed of parts of speech, tenses, punctuation, idioms, pair of words and much more which majority of us knows and wants to learn further. But the point of fact is that all of this knowledge is now a part of our subconscious brain. Thus, it is true to say that knowing is never enough, but practicing is. Accordingly, in order to practice English grammar you can purchase a grammar book and spare a minimum half hour to work on grammar on a daily basis. Additionally, in the era of today, you can seek training on YouTube or from various online platforms under kind supervision of coaches. Additionally, it is important to note that never fear making mistakes. Being a beginner you have certainly the right to make mistakes and rectify them. As practice makes the man perfect, so it is important to stay consistent to your learning schedules!

    <a href="#"> The LAST LECTURE by Randy Pausch</a>
    <p>
        ‘The last lecture’ is a must-read autobiography inscribed by Randy Pausch, an American educator and a professor of computer science <span id="dots58">...</span>
        <span id="more58" style="display: none;">   at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, and Jeffrey Zaslow, a well-known coauthor of top ranked books. In this book, Pausch, an optimist dreamer, narrates a bright side of his story even after being diagnosed with ten tumors in his liver. Randy throws light on the last lecture which he delivered before his demise, which was all about his beliefs about high aims. He emphasized never to have obsessions on what people think. The same, he discussed childhood dreams, overcoming hindrances, and knowing about the intellectual-emotional fact that ‘Time is all you have. And you may find one day that you have less than you think.’ To sum it up, this memoir is enlightened with humor, aptitude and motivation.

                <h2>About us</h2>
                <p> Welcome to Wordophic! It is the brainchild of Adnan Khan and Eman Ahmad Shaikh which highlights different flavors of life. As far as its journey is concerned, Wordophic commenced when we identified the lack of space for writers and prosers
                    in publishing industry. "I once tried to publish a magazine but didn 't know the publication process." -Eman Ahmad Shaikh. This idea popped up the next significant step of Wordophic in mind. It took some days in research to grow Pakistan's
                    online ecosystem. Wordophic has dogged belief that the right to be published should not be fourwalled or limited upto certain writing topics but to be secular in writings. So the contents are written by our in-house team which showcases
                    its work and beget healthy discussions. Wordophic also helps students master public writing signature, building self-esteem and learn about literature and narration. . </p>
